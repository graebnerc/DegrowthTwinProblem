Strains and stresses in an epitaxial Ni(111)/Mo(110) multilayer grown by direct ion beam sputtering,"An epitaxial Ni(111)/Mo(110) multilayer was grown on a (11 (2) over bar0) oriented monocrystalline sapphire substrate in a high vacuum sputtering deposition system. The strain and stress state of the layers has been measured with X-ray diffraction in symmetric and asymmetric geometries. Non-equal biaxial coherency stresses due to the Nishiyama-Wassermann epitaxial relation between both lattices are clearly evidenced, The Values of the stress-free lattice parameters of molybdenum and nickel sublayers, deduced from the global stress analysis, supports the hypothesis of an interfacial alloying effect between layers with diffusion of nickel in the Mo layers and, to a lesser degree, of molybdenum in Ni layers. Oil the other hand, the Ni layers appear nearly fully relaxed, A detailed analysis of the stresses in the film shows a strong contribution of a compressive stress field due to possible post-growth atomic rearrangements occurring inside the multilayered film.

Top-down approaches for measuring expression ratios of intact yeast proteins using Fourier transform mass spectrometry,"The extension of quantitation methods for small peptides to ions above 5 kDa, and eventually to global quantitative proteomics of intact proteins, will require extensive refinement of current analytical approaches. Here we evaluate postgrowth Cys-labeling and N-14/N-15 metabolic labeling strategies for determination of relative protein expression levels and their posttranslational modifications using top-down mass spectrometry (MS). We show that intact proteins that are differentially alkylated with acrylamide (+71 Da) versus iodoacetamide (+57 Da) have substantial chromatographic shifts during reversed-phase liquid chromatography separation (particularly in peak tails), indicating a requirement for stable isotopes in alkylation tags for top-down MS. In the N-14/N-15 metabolic labeling strategy, we achieve 98% N-15 incorporation in yeast grown 10 generations under aerobic conditions and determine 50 expression ratios using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS in comparing these cells to anaerobically grown control (N-14) cells. We devise quantitative methods for top-down analyses, including a correction factor for accurate protein ratio determination based upon the signal-to-noise ratio. Using a database of 200 yeast protein forms identified previously by top-down MS, we verify the intact mass tag concept for protein identification without tandem MS. Overall, we find that top-down MS promises work flows capable of large-scale proteome profiling using stable isotope labeling and the determination of > 5 protein ratios per spectrum.",10.1021/ac050993p,Claudius,,No,,Not about degrowth,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,April
"DEGROWTH BUT, WHERE?","It is almost impossible to disagree with a proposal seeking to slow things down to minimize harm to the planet. However, the question is where. The manifesto in The Case for Degrowth acknowledges the challenge of asking distinct populations to lower their economic growth and well-being. They suggest alliances, echoing the commons, and highlight ancient cultural traditions that have envisioned other worlds. In contrast, the discussion offered by Deepak Lamba-Nieves through the case of Puerto Rico and its colonial subjugation - shared or equivalent to many in the Global South and elsewhere - asks us to reflect upon who is demanding or expecting us to degrowth.",,Claudius,,Yes,,"This was an excerpt from their book ""The Case for Degrowth""; what to do?",,,,,,,,,,Not core,Drop,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
Hyper-individualism and ultrasociality in a Veblenian framework,"In a series of articles Gowdy and Krall (2013, 2016a, 2016b) framed the process of cumulative social change as a codevelopment of hyper-individualism and ultrasociality. They argue that at the macro level the 'global economic system' behaves as a superorganism which has co-opted human beings' cooperative propensity in order to continuously expand its surplus value, appropriating an ever-larger share of natural resources. At the micro level, the neoliberal era has legitimized increased competition among individuals and has led to a hyper focus on the maximization of individual consumption. In their social context individuals appear to be largely oblivious or dismissive of the growing superorganism as is evidenced by public unwillingness to address situations of global environmental stress. In the context of Veblen's evolutionary thinking, this paper comments on Gowdy and Krall's articles by discussing two potential venues to 'tame' the superorganism: de-growth and post nationalism. It is argued that the former may be a solution only as a result of a severe (ecological) collapse scenario. Thus if the social desire to modify the superorganism exists it will have a greater chance to succeed as a post-national project that would provide a structural scaffolding to place the superorganism within human control.

Post-Growth in the Global South? Some Reflections from India and Bhutan,"The critique of growth is one of the defining features of ecological economics. Yet ecological economists have had relatively little to say about post-growth in the global South. In this article, we propose a new definition of post-growth as the combined application and theorization of degrowth, agrowth, steady-state economics and post-development. We then discuss with special reference to India seven ways of thinking about post-growth in the global South. Starting with the basic observation that the current patterns of growth-fueled development are ecologically, socially and financially unsustainable, we argue that serious post-growth thinking can only be world-systemic and rooted in class analyses. We then point out that the GDP growth against poverty connection is debatable and we instead argue, normatively, that an effective post-growth program should focus on fulfilled needs and on wealth redistribution. Against the idea that growth-critical approaches have their origin in industrialized countries, we show that many post-growth ideas have non-Western roots and a substantial number of potential contemporary allies in the global South. Discussing the example of Bhutan, we suggest that preliminary elements of a post-growth program are not as utopian as it might sound.",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.02.020,Claudius,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,Core,,,,,Commonalities,Theoretical,,,Core,November

"Geographies of degrowth: Nowtopias, resurgences and the decolonization of imaginaries and places","The term 'decroissance' (degrowth) signifies a process of political and social transformation that reduces a society's material and energy use while improving the quality of life. Degrowth calls for decolonizing imaginaries and institutions from - in Ursula Le Guin's words - 'a one-way future consisting only of growth'. Recent scholarship has focused on the ecological and social costs of growth, on policies that may secure prosperity without growth, and the study of grassroots alternatives pre-figuring a post-growth future. There has been limited engagement, however, with the geographical aspects of degrowth. This special issue addresses this gap, looking at the rooted experiences of peoples and collectives rebelling against, and experimenting with alternatives to, growth-based development. Our contributors approach such resurgent or 'nowtopian' efforts from a decolonial perspective, focusing on how they defend and produce new places, new subjectivities and new state relations. The stories told span from the Indigenous territories of the Chiapas in Mexico and Adivasi communities in southern India, to the streets of Athens, the centres of power in Turkey and the riverbanks of West Sussex.",10.1177/2514848619869689,Claudius,,No,,"Relevant topic, but only an editorial",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November

Distributed degrowth technology: Challenges for blockchain beyond the green economy,"This commentary considers the challenges and trade-offs in using blockchain as the facilitating digital infrastructure for degrowth projects. A blockchain is simply a distributed database. The technology is being used for a wide range of applications relevant to economic exchange and environmental sustainability. Many degrowth scholars wholly reject technical fixes for politically induced environmental crises, seeing blockchain projects as wasteful and counter to convivial social relations. Others highlight the technology's potential for facilitating redistributive and regenerative economies, but without much detail. This paper argues that if blockchain is ever to prove useful for the degrowth movement it would need to overcome challenges in three important areas: 1) building democratic and (re)distributive economies, 2) regenerating the environment without commodifying it, and 3) facilitating international alliances without imposing a particular set of values. What is certain is that technology on its own will not transcend the political struggles tackled by degrowth activists. However, under certain conditions, blockchain might make those struggles more effective.",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107020,Claudius,,No,,Different focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
On the increase of social capital in degrowth economy,"The present work provides a theoretical analysis oriented to link the social capital to the concept of degrowth. Defined by Schneider et al., (2010) as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances ecological conditions at the local and global level in the short and in the long term, the concept of degrowth leads to a radical criticism of the neoclassical approach of economic growth and propose an alternative socio-economic paradigm based on the concept of reciprocity work. Constituted by a mix of social work, unpaid activities, self-production and cooperation among individuals, reciprocity work is assumed to be able to increase the social capital by promoting conviviality, mutual sustain and social relationships. In recent years, academic, political and social debates have been oriented to investigate the concepts of degrowth and the related impacts on social capital and well-being. The objective this paper is twofold. On one side, it provides a theoretical analysis in an attempt of explaining the concept of degrowth, that of reciprocity work and the implications for the social capital formation. On the other side, it reviews the main studies that investigate the social capital generation in a context of degrowth. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Degrowth within - Aligning circular economy and strong sustainability narratives,"This perspective calls for building greater understanding of overlapping and conflicting considerations between the sustainability principles that inform current conceptions of circular economy and degrowth. We contend that scholars and practitioners need to be pragmatic and to recognize evident ideological differences, but simultaneously to acknowledge beneficial similarities and complements. The common aim of both frameworks - to change business-as-usual and to enable human society to operate within ecological planetary boundaries - will likely engender opportunities to formulate new solutions. Management of the inherent tensions, such as the scale and scope of rebound effects, will continue to pose challenges. However, with thoughtful dialogue, commitment to respectful discourse, and more refined articulation we are confident that progress will be made. By building on synergies and seeking holistic strategies, the academic community, along with its transdisciplinary partners, can advance strong global sustainability efforts.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.03.038,Claudius,,No,,No consideration of GS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
Is archaeology conceivable within the degrowth movement?,"Since the 1980s, archaeology has been further embedded in a reinforced and accelerating capitalist ideology, namely neo-liberalism. Most archaeologists had no alternative but to adapt to it through concessions to the free-market economy and to the so-called mitigations taking place within development. However, it is now apparent that the ongoing global socio-ecological disaster we are facing cannot be reversed with compromises but rather with a radical engagement against the injunctions of competition and growth. I suggest that we must anticipate the necessary transformations of archaeology in the coming decades, before archaeology becomes a technical avatar of the neo-liberal dogma, or before its complete annihilation for being deemed 'superfluous' (Wurst 2019, 171) by the capitalist regime. In this paper, I will use the idea of 'degrowth' to propose a new paradigm for archaeology by applying the concepts of civil disobedience, voluntary simplicity, redistribution of means and the ethics of no-growth.",10.1017/S1380203821000015,Claudius,,No,,Different focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
Corporate Social Responsibility and Managerial Competencies: A Dynamic Requirement,"Managers today are usually sensitive to issues of social responsibility and ethical behavior because of public pressure, legal and governmental concerns and media coverage. Corporate responsibility or sustainability is considered a prominent feature of business and societal concerns. It is high time that the persons governing the organization must be aware of the changing with the competitive environment. Therefore, the management education must change and shift towards a more integrated rather than a handicap knowledge economy. Indirectly it sets out the goal of updating manager's role and meaning of socially responsible leadership skills. This research paper will give an insight into the leadership in the field of management to create a clearer understanding of what is required in global business environment, creating demands on international managers to take a positive step on issues of social responsibility and ethical behavior, economic development and ecological protection. Also, it will analyze the current development through Triple Bottom Line for sustainable development.",,Claudius,,No,,No consideration of GS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
"Global Climate Emergency: after COP24, climate science, urgency, and the threat to humanity","This Special Editorial on the Climate Emergency makes the case that although we are living in the time of Global Climate Emergency we are not yet acting as if we are in an imminent crisis. The authors review key aspects of the institutional response and climate science over the past several decades and the role of the economic system in perpetuating inertia on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Humanity is now the primary influence on the planet, and events in and around COP24 are the latest reminder that we live in a pathological system. A political economy has rendered the UNFCCC process as yet a successful failure. Fundamental change is urgently required.

Sustaining our future: resolving the conflict over population models,If we are to sustain our future we have to resolve some fundamental issues about how to live on this planet. However underneath it all is a major issue: are there just too many of us? This paper will try to assess the question by looking at two conflicting models that stem from biology and from economics and try to suggest that the conflict can be resolved with new approaches to sustainable cities. It suggests that population issues on a global level need to be addressed as a matter of human rights but fear of population can be a dangerous diversion and prevent cities from grasping the opportunities (provided by growth) to achieve significant urban sustainability gains.,,Claudius,,No,,Different focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
GREEN PREFERENCES OF GENERATION Y,"Increasing level of economic welfare in certain countries around the globe brings lots of issues where environmental challenges play a special role. Critics of consuming lifestyle of developed countries led to couple of initiatives against the Growth (as the economic mainstream) such as Degrowth or Green and Circular models of economy. Lot of businesses switched to environmental strategies due to changes of legislative, pressure of stakeholders or consumers' buying behaviour. International business environment influence significantly final consumers' markets, especially in countries where interdependence is high. Environmental business concept tries to attract consumers through emphasis of environmental (green) attributes of products. This paper deals with preferences of certain group of consumers, known as generation Y, towards green products. To reveal green preferences the survey method was carried out using a questionnaire. The research was carried out in the Slovak Republic within the sample of generation Y respondents. Basic findings showed that the awareness of green products among a sample of respondents is rather positive. Consumers of generation Y with higher education are willing to prefer green products even if their price is higher. These products must have a clearly recognized environmental label. Regarding attributes of green products, consumers perceived them as high-quality, value-formoney, human-friendly and environmentally friendly. Respondents do not prefer green products to increase their prestige in society, they realize that their actions and lifestyle can influence environmental impacts and contribute to have a better environment.",,Claudius,,No,,Different focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
READY FOR CHANGE? INTERLINKAGES OF TRADITIONAL AND NOVEL PRACTICES THROUGH PERMACULTURE,"This paper is based on ongoing participatory action research in Latvia since 2016. The research was initially developed within the Marie Curie Innovative Training Network SUSPLACE and is further advanced by the Latvian Council of Science funded project `Ready for change? Sustainable management of common natural resources (RFC)'. By using this approach, the researchers aim to, firstly, synthesise natural, climate science and economic systems evidence of the immense transformations required towards regeneration and, secondly, engage in active knowledge brokerage and societal change advancement. Authors encourage to limit the application of the abused term `sustainable' as it has rather meant to `sustain the unsustainable' across the last decades and to follow the logic of `regeneration' instead. The bridging of practices with the permaculture movement can be summarised in three broad groups of regenerative transformations to develop resilience against environmental breakdown - firstly, organic growing or gardening, secondly, ecological building, and thirdly, ecological lifestyle practices. These examples are arising both from particular collaborations with the selected permaculture homesteads as well as from the general environmental and social activism in Latvia. A common expression claims that `everything new is well forgotten old'. It resonates very well with the permaculture ethics and movement emphasising not forgetting yet critically assessing the long-developed skills and practices. This paper demonstrates that in addition to the challenging global aims, on the local level the success of permaculture depends on its ability to be deeply embedded in localities and revive cultural, local practices that people feel a connection to.",10.22616/ESRD.2021.55.056,Claudius,,No,,Different focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,November
Big Questions and Big Data: A Reply from the Collaboratory,"In our reply to Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk's Big Questions and Big Data: The Role of Labour and Labour Relations in Recent Global Economic History, we focus on her observations on the Global Collaboratory on the History of Labour Relations. We endorse many of her suggestions to connect global labour and economic history and to regard labour relations not only as a dependent variable. In fact, as the examples from various Collab workshops and publications show, some of these ideas are already being put into practice. These examples also show that if we seriously want to combine global labour and economic history data and join the debate on the growth (or decrease) in social inequality, workers' individual and collective agency must be taken on board. Finally, we argue that global labour and economic historians can benefit most from each other's disciplines by truly working together in collaborative projects, developing new theories, perhaps less grand than those with which economic historians attract so much attention, but more profound.

Dans notre reponse a Grandes questions et megadonnees : le role du travail et des relations de travail dans l'histoire economique mondiale recente d'Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk, nous nous concentrons sur ses observations sur le Collaboratoire. Nous approuvons un grand nombre de ses suggestions de relier le travail mondial et l'histoire economique, et de ne pas considerer les relations de travail seulement comme une variable dependante. En fait, comme le montrent les exemples tires de divers ateliers-debat et publications du Collaboratoire, certaines de ces idees sont deja en train d'etre mises en pratique. Ces exemples montrent aussi que si nous voulons serieusement combiner les donnees du travail mondial avec l'histoire economique et participer au debat sur la hausse (ou la baisse) des inegalites sociales. Enfin, nous soutenons que les historiens du travail mondial et les historiens economistes peuvent profiter de leurs disciplines respectives en travaillant veritablement ensemble dans des projets collaboratifs, en developpant de nouvelles theories, peut-etre moins chatoyantes que celles avec lesquelles les historiens economistes attirent tant d'attention, mais plus profondes.

Die Rolle der Arbeit und der Arbeitsbeziehungen in der jungeren globalen Wirtschaftsgeschichte konzentrieren wir uns auf ihre Beobachtungen zum Collaboratory. Wir stimmen vielen ihrer Anregungen zu, globale Arbeitsgeschichte und globale Wirtschaftsgeschichte miteinander zu verbinden und Arbeitsbeziehungen nicht allein als abhangige Variable zu begreifen. Tatsachlich belegen viele von Vertretern beider Disziplinen organisierte Workshops und gemeinsame Veroffentlichungen, dass solche uberlegungen bereits praktisch umgesetzt werden. Diese Beispiele zeigen auch, dass die individuelle und kollektive Handlungsfahigkeit der Arbeiter berucksichtigt werden muss, wenn wir die Daten der globalen Arbeitsgeschichte und die der globalen Wirtschaftsgeschichte zusammenfuhren und uns an der Debatte uber die Ausweitung (oder die Verringerung) sozialer Ungleichheit beteiligen wollen. Abschlie ss end argumentieren wir dahingehend, dass globale Arbeits- und globale Wirtschaftshistoriker dann am starksten von der jeweils anderen Disziplin profitieren konnen, wenn sie in Kooperationsprojekten zusammenarbeiten und dabei neue Theorien entwickeln, die vielleicht weniger grandios ausfallen als diejenigen, mit denen Wirtschaftshistoriker Aufsehen erregen, dafur aber auch tiefgreifender sind. ubersetzung: Max Henninger Karin Hofmeester and Christine Moll-Murata.
