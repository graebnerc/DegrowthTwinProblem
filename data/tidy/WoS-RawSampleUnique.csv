J,"Sharpley, R",,,,"Sharpley, Richard",,,Tourism and Development Theory: Which Way Now?,TOURISM PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Development theory; modernisation theory; dependency theory; environmental crisis; degrowth,ECONOMICS; GROWTH; STATE,"Tourism has long been explored through the lens of development theory. David Harrison was one of the earlier academics to do so, subsequently turning his attention to critiquing the relevance of such theory to tourism, concluding that although much tourism research has been framed within it, development theory has contributed little if anything to knowledge and understanding of the tourism-development nexus. Recognising David Harrison's contribution to the field, this paper reviews his critique of development theory as related to tourism before going on to suggest that the increasingly popular notion of degrowth offers an alternative conceptual lens though which tourism and development may be viewed. More specifically, it argues that within the context of the global environmental crisis and the need to address growth-inspired excessive production and consumption, degrowth can be considered a viable approach to or theory of development that demands attention in the context of tourism.","[Sharpley, Richard] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Management, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Sharpley, R (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Management, Preston, Lancs, England.",rajsharpley@uclan.ac.uk,,,,,,,,4,4,5,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,TOUR PLAN DEV,Tour.

This paper draws attention to the German version of degrowth, Postwachstum, as a possible Post-Development approach in the North.

The paper examines key Postwachstum contributions with regard to their correspondence to insights of and gaps in the Post-Development debate. It argues that Postwachstum needs to include a postcolonial perspective on global inequalities and question the 'development'-modernity-coloniality nexus more profoundly in order to provide a valuable contribution to the Post-Development agenda.","[Bendix, Daniel] Univ Kassel, Inst Polit Sci, Fac Social Sci, Dept Dev & Postcolonial Studies, Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Bendix, D (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Inst Polit Sci, Fac Social Sci, Dept Dev & Postcolonial Studies, Kassel, Germany.",danyellow@posteo.de,,,"DFG Research Group 'Landnahme, Acceleration, Activation.

So far, the global dimensions of such a transformation in the Global North have arguably not received the required attention. This article critically reflects on the requirements of a degrowth approach that promotes global intragenerational justice without falling into the trap of reproducing (neo-)colonial continuities. Our account of social justice is inherently tied to questions of gender justice. A postcolonial reading of feminist standpoint theory provides the theoretical framework for the discussion. In responding to two main points of criticism raised by feminist scholars from the Global South, it is argued that degrowth activism and scholarship has to reflect on its coloniality and necessarily needs to seek alliances with social movements from around the world on equal footing. Acknowledging that this task is far from easy, some cornerstones of a feminist decolonial degrowth approach are outlined.","[Dengler, Corinna] Univ Vechta, Feminist Econ, Vechta, Germany; [Seebacher, Lisa Marie] Ctr Social Innovat, Vienna, Austria",,"Dengler, C (corresponding author), Univ Vechta, Feminist Econ, Vechta, Germany.",corinna.dengler@uni-vechta.de; seebacher@zsi.at,,,,,,,,36,36,3,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We offer constructive decolonial and feminist critiques to foster their productive alliances with multiple feminisms, Indigenous, post-development and pluriversal thought and design (Escobar, 2018), and people on the ground. Our suggested pathway of decolonial transition includes re-situating degrowth relative to the global south and to Indigenous and other resistance movements. We see this decolonial degrowth as a profoundly material strategy of recovery, renewal, and resistance (resurgence) through practices of re-rooting and re-commoning. To illustrate what we mean by resurgence we draw from two examples where people are engaged in ongoing struggles to protect their territories from the impacts of rampant growth-Zapatista and allied Indigenous groups in Mexico, and three Adivasi communities in the Attappady region of southern India. They are building economies and ecologies of resurgence and simultaneous resistance to growth by deterritorialization. We argue that a decolonized degrowth must be what the growth paradigm is not, and imagine what does not yet exist: our separate and collective socio-ecological futures of sufficiency and celebration in the multiple worlds of the pluriverse. Together, the two cases demonstrate pathways to autonomy, sufficiency, and resurgence of territories and worlds, through persistence, innovation, and mobilization of traditional and new knowledges. We offer these as teachers for the transition to decolonial degrowth.","[Nirmal, Padini; Rocheleau, Dianne] Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Nirmal, P (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Learning & Evaluat Program, Women Peace & Secur Program, Earth Inst, 475 Riverside Dr,AC4, New York, NY 10115 USA.",pn2338@columbia.edu,,,National Science Foundation s Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) Grant; American Institute of Indian Studies,National Science Foundation s Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) Grant; American Institute of Indian Studies,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge research support from the National Science Foundation s Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) Grant and a Junior Research Fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies.",,,44,44,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

Yet scholars of International Political Economy (IPE) have been surprisingly slow to address its wide-ranging implications and, thus, to advance debates about post-growth alternatives. The premise of the article is that for IPE to deepen its grasp of the escalation of contemporary socioecological crises both analytically and normatively, it needs to put the growth question front and center. To problematize the pursuit of economic growth from an IPE perspective, we bring together research on green growth, post-growth/degrowth, sustainability transitions and socioecological transformation. More specifically, we develop an analytical framework that revolves around four pathways of reorganization toward socioecological sustainability: (1) modification, (2) substitution, (3) conversion and (4) prefiguration. We use illustrative examples from the plastics and food sectors to show how the post-growth pathways of conversion and prefiguration could interact to trigger change for sustainability. Notably, our discussion reveals that conversion, which requires a strong state for developing post-growth institutions, is the least traveled pathway in both sectors. This insight points to a strategic priority for post-growth proponents and an urgent research agenda for IPE scholars.","[Hasselbalch, Jacob A.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Kranke, Matthias] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany; [Kranke, Matthias] Univ Duisburg Essen, Kate Hamburger Kolleg Ctr Global Cooperat Res, Duisburg, Germany; [Chertkovskaya, Ekaterina] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Copenhagen Business School; Universitat Kassel; University of Duisburg Essen; Lund University,"Chertkovskaya, E (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden.",ekaterina.chertkovskaya@miljo.lth.se,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, deprioritizing economic growth is challenging because it is the antithesis of business as we know it today. Yet, in this study, we find examples of enterprises operating in the renewable energy industry in the Global South, which deprioritize traditional economic growth as their preferred indicator of success. We interviewed 30 renewable energy enterprises (REEs) on the basis of an importance-performance analysis (IPA). Our findings confirm that conventional measures of financial performance are not universally applicable to all enterprises in the Global South. Specifically, we observed that the REEs that are least satisfied with conventional economic performance indicators possess two characteristics in common: (1) they have strong social motivations (e.g., energy access and poverty alleviation) and (2) they are averse to economic growth in the traditional sense. We draw insights from these REEs for the future of post-growth enterprise, including the importance of localness in success and performance appraisal as the Global South transitions toward degrowth. We also introduce 14 alternative performance indicators, suggested by the REEs themselves, which may help bring enterprises closer to post-growth orientation in the Global South.","[Gabriel, Cle-Anne; Nazar, Samira; Zhu, Danfeng] Univ Queensland, United Nations Principles Responsible Management, Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Nazar, Samira; Zhu, Danfeng] Univ Queensland, Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kirkwood, Jodyanne] Otago Polytech, Profess Practice Program, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; Otago Polytechnic,"Gabriel, CA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",cleanne.gabriel@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,,7,7,2,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,ALTERNATIVES,Alternatives,MAY,2019,44,2-4,,,,,119,137,,10.1177/0304375419853148,0,,,19,International Relations,,International Relations,IW6AU,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000485060200003,0,en

The post-growth world, while subject to significant uncertainty and heterogeneity, will be characterized by profound hazards and discontinuities for both human and natural systems.

Drawing on a resourcification approach in which resources are un-derstood as outcomes of various social processes, this study analyses how resources are conceptualised and understood in degrowth scholarship. Our study shows that resources are seen in two interlinked ways, first as a critique of the environmental and social costs of current resourcification practices (the becoming of resources), and second as a combination of transformative proposals calling for de-resourcification practices (the unbe-coming of resources). By approaching degrowth in terms of a dynamics of resourcification and de-resourcification that we call resource shifting, we contribute to a problematisation of the concept of resource that opens new socio-ecological pathways to post-growth societies.","[Corvellec, Herve] Lund Univ, Dept Serv Studies, Lund, Sweden; [Paulsson, Alexander] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Paulsson, Alexander] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, POB 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University,"Paulsson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, POB 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",herve.corvellec@ism.lu.se; alexander.paulsson@fek.lu.se,,,,,,,,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper is rooted in the growing field of 'degrowth' and 'post-growth' research that empirically and theoretically challenges the possibility and viability of (further) growth-based economic development. Through a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed journal articles, this paper takes stock of the increasing interest of post-growth scholars in cities and urban spaces. This paper identifies seven ways in which cities feature in the post-growth literature: as arenas, as spaces of encounter, as spaces with specific qualities, as (introversive) agents, as targets, as specific scale, and as interdependent configurations. Building on this collection of perspectives on growth-related research in (differently defined) urban contexts, this paper argues that the emergent field of urban post-growth would profit from a common frame of reference and research agenda around which urban post-growth perspectives can cohere. This paper proposes three key areas of research on post-growth in, by, and of cities while putting questions around the growth dependencies of urban systems front and center.","[Schmid, Benedikt] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Schmid, B (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",benedikt.schmid@geographie.uni-freiburg.de,,,Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Freiburg,Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Freiburg,I acknowledge support by the Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Freiburg.,,,0,0,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,14,19,,,,,,,11926,10.3390/su141911926,0,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5I0OI,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000868067100001,0,en

We conceptualize different key aspects to understand and reframe rebound effects. On the origin side, we introduce the key concept of resource efficient paths, to show how productivity is a changing and complex issue, affected by the interaction of all other resources that produce goods or services, as well as behavior. This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the existence of rebound effects. On the expansion side we introduce the notion of systemic insatiability as key in the expansion and consolidation of rebounds through socioeconomic systems, and sufficient condition for the existence of rebound effects. Moreover, we analyze how inequality can exacerbate insatiability. With this framework in mind, we examine two main positions to find solutions: In the first, under our current socioeconomic, cultural, and institutional structures, we analyze different means of public policy intervention: resources pricing, cap-and-trade systems, regulation, and voluntary actions. The second position implies tackling systemic changes. Here we explore different post-growth systemic alternatives: steady-state, degrowth, agrowth, and post-development intellectual currents in relation to rebounds and Jevons Paradox.","[Freire-Gonzalez, Jaume] ENT Fdn, Josep Llanza 1-7,2 3, Barcelona 08800, Spain",,"Freire-Gonzalez, J (corresponding author), ENT Fdn, Josep Llanza 1-7,2 3, Barcelona 08800, Spain.",jfreire@ent.cat,,,Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral program of the Government of Catalonia's Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge,Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral program of the Government of Catalonia's Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge,This article received the support of the Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral program of the Government of Catalonia's Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge.

We conduct a comprehensive systematic review of the prevalent themes in the existing literature on the ecological economics of degrowth, and its engagements with North-South relations and gender issues. The analysis identifies seven research areas where ecological economics can better integrate these matters, namely: the study of post-growth policies for the Global South; the unequal exchanges that sustain an imperial mode of living; the deconstruction of ecological economic concepts that reproduce problematic Western or gendered assumptions; the study of the clash of metabolisms in peripheries of the Global South; the metabolism of care-work in growth economies; the leading role of women in ecological distribution conflicts, and the reproduction of gender inequalities in alternative post-growth spaces.

This is done by putting forward insurrectionary political ecology as a lens of research and struggle, through the confluence of the complementary political practice of insurrectionary anarchism and the ecological method of no-till natural farming. While seemingly different, the article argues that these practices are compatible, animating a political ecology of resistance around anti-authoritarian political and ecological lifeways. This direction, or compass, of insurrectionary political ecology is discussed in relation to other autonomous tendencies, as it complements and strengthens existing critical schools of thought heavily influenced by political ecology, such as (decolonial) degrowth, environmental justice and post-development. Insurrectionary political ecology deepens connections with scholarly rebels in political and ecological struggles outside-and rejecting-the university system. The article includes discussions of research ethics, various conceptions of activism, autonomous tendencies and existing differences between the concepts of revolution and insurrection, in order to debate notions of counter-hegemony and duelpower. The overall purpose here is to offer a theoretical ethos for a political ecology of resistance that invigorates political praxis to subvert the ongoing socio-ecological catastrophes.","[Dunlap, Alexander] Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm SUM, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Dunlap, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm SUM, Oslo, Norway.",alexander.a.dunlap@gmail.com,,,,,,,,11,11,1,5,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

The analysis of an updated inventory of 296 environmental conflicts in the EJAtlas for these four countries reaches the following conclusions: extractivism causes environmental conflicts related to mining, fossil fuels, hydropower and biomass; indigenous, Afro-descendant and peasant communities are the most affected; behind the conflicts, there are not only environmental impacts but also social impacts that concern livelihoods, land deprivation and work insecurity, and also loss of cultural practices and cultural identity; most of the forms of collective action used in protests are peaceful, most notably petitions, street marches, media activism, lawsuits, while States and companies criminalize activists and are often violent (with about 75 cases in which there are deaths or disappearance of environmental defenders); socio-environmental movements (that sometimes include environmental NGOs) have achieved relative success, stopping 59 of the 296 conflict-generating projects and giving birth to new forms of resistance. While successfully stopping single projects cannot be construed as a general critique of economic growth, such attempts are congruent with post-development, community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive Andean visions such as buen vivir or surnak kawsay.

This growth has been associated with large-scale ecological degradation and violent localized extractive operations. Further, the ongoing rates of sand extraction are already resulting in emerging global and local sand scarcities. However, there is a significant lack of critical analysis of the ongoing patterns of consumption and distribution of aggregate resources, as well as on alternative pathways to address their overextraction and inefficient distribution. This article conducts a systemic qualitative literature review to a) highlight the basis of high rates of sand extraction by exploring its interlinkages with economic growth and development; and b) conceptualize alternative pathways for aggregate utilization in a socioecologically viable manner. It articulates how economic growth and development lie at the foundation of over-extraction and inefficient distribution of aggregates, and proposes that solutions to the emergent sand crisis lie in critical scholarly works that discuss post-growth based systemic changes. It analyses post-growth, postdevelopment, steady-state economics, and degrowth literature to provide alternative approaches for transitions that can simultaneously address both the reduction of overall throughput and more equitable distribution of aggregates. It concludes with five post-growth proposals: reduction of per-capita units of consumption of sandbased products; designing and implementing degrowth cities; revival of traditional and vernacular architectures, designs and knowledges; transitioning away from concrete as the primary building material by exploring location and climate specific alternate building materials; and reducing, limiting, or banning mega-infrastructures and mega-structures.","[Bisht, Arpita] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Bisht, Arpita] Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bisht, A (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.;Bisht, A (corresponding author), Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",bisht@iss.nl,,,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie [707404],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie,This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie [grant agreement number 707404].,,,6,6,1,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We suggest that the buzzword innovation is progressively infiltrating the lexicon and situated practices of development. Within this a hegemonic framing of innovation is emerging that leverages the language of inclusion to promote connection to, and participation in, the global free market economy. This, we hypothesise is closing down a broader debate concerning the goals and roles of innovation and technology in the so called developing world. At the same time, our research suggests that this emerging hegemony is contested, presenting as alternative, minority framings with different normative underpinnings for technology and innovation that challenge the pro-growth and market-led dominant paradigm. We present the results of one of these through a qualitative in-depth case study conducted in the Indian state of Kerala. The case provides interesting insights for the degrowth community in two regards. First it shows a concrete example of an alternative framing of technology underpinned by a set of normative principles connected to those of degrowth. Second, the case shows that alternative technological paradigms based on principles aligned with those of degrowth are not only possible, but can and do co-exist with the hegemonic paradigm.

A critical discussion,JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH; FUTURE; CITY,"Degrowth is establishing itself as a theory within the ecological and post-development scholarship. At the core of degrowth is a local-centric perspective, whereby small urban agglomerations are considered as the key actors of the political and economic system of an imagined post-consumerist and post-capitalist society. Degrowth proponents thus argue that the fundamental steps to achieve a truly democratic, socially just and ecological society should be taken at local level. However, in the degrowth theory a thorough debate about why the local level would be the most suitable spatial units to achieve degrowth is scarce. The importance of the small urban size appears to be axiomatic, rather than supported by substantive arguments. By engaging with non-mainstream strands of green political thought, this paper critically reflects upon the local-centred perspective at the core of the degrowth theory, identifying its main practical and theoretical shortcomings.","[Mocca, Elisabetta] Univ Vienna, Dept Sociol, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Mocca, E (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Sociol, Vienna, Austria.",elisabetta.mocca@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,,15,15,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J POLIT IDEOL,J.

Galbraith turned to the causes of the Great Financial Crisis beginning in 2007. The central question was if the (supposed) pre-crisis normality of high growth rates could be reestablished - which Galbraith, from the perspective of abiophysical analytical framework and with view to the structural problems of high energy prices, geopolitical instability, technological change and the faulty design of the financial system, doubted. In the present paper, Galbraith reconsiders his central theses and explains why he holds on to them in spite of recent economic recovery and other developments like falling oil prices, and what, from his point of view, speaks against areturn to anew normal. In addition, he discusses what political implications follow from his diagnosis. Klaus Dorre introduces Galbraith's approach and underlines its relevance for the thematic context of capitalism, growth and democracy. For Dorre, Galbraith shows that post-growth capitalisms have, at least in the societies of the Global North, long become areality - which is why it makes little sense to reserve the concept of post-growth society for utopic visions of the future, yet all the more to engage with Galbraith's call for policies suited to an economy of slow growth.","[Galbraith, James K.] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch, Austin, TX 78713 USA; [Doerre, Klaus] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Soziol, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Dorre, K (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Soziol, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",Galbraith@mail.utexas.edu; klaus.doerre@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,,0,0,1,5,VS VERLAG SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTEN-GWV FACHVERLAGE GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN-STR 46, 65189 WIESBADEN, GERMANY",,,,BERL J SOZIOL,Berliner J.

While the movement engages with gender politics peripherally in coalition with feminist schools of thought and activist groups, e.g., the feminisms and degrowth alliance, I argue the politics of gender, race, and labor are fundamentally tied to the development of a modern capitalist global system and therefore must be central in the understanding and praxis of non-capitalist alternatives. In this article, I examine how a decolonial feminist approach can address this condition by challenging the epistemes and ontologies that constitute modern colonial systems of power and furthering plural understandings and practices of being, seeing, and knowing across the North-South divide. By engaging in decolonial feminist praxis, degrowth stands to better address, dislodge, and reimagine the elements and relations that maintain an ideology of growth, building instead towards a stronger coalition across movements that encourages socially just and ecologically sustainable futures.","[Abazeri, Mariam] Univ Miami, 1320 S Dixie Hwy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",University of Miami,"Abazeri, M (corresponding author), Univ Miami, 1320 S Dixie Hwy, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",Mxa1484@miami.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,4,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,FUTURES,Futures,FEB,2022,136,,,,,,,,102902,10.1016/j.futures.2022.102902,0,,JAN 2022,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1W5HU,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000806805200002,0,en

While it shares a number of basic principles with various post-growth conceptualisations, the WE' s language and concepts tend to be more adaptable to different social and economic contexts, thus penetrating into policy processes and connecting to a variety of cultural traits, not only in advanced economies but also in less industrialised nations. In this paper, we describe the key features of the WE, including its approach to key concepts like work, productivity and technology and several examples of its policy impact.

Considering Jineoloji as the most original dimension of the Democratic Confederalist model of government in Northern and Eastern Syria (compared to other revolutionary projects), the article contributes to recent debates around the central place of depatriarchization in pluriverse debates. In the first part, we highlight a renewed interest in matriarchy, which has emerged at the intersection of ecofeminist with post-development and degrowth thought, noting how this resonates with the rediscovery of Mesopotamia's matristic culture, which has been key to Democratic Confederalism and its radical critique of capitalist modernity and the nation State. We also highlight the inherent contradictions of the matristic model and formulate the question whether, and under what conditions, it bears potential for emancipatory political ecologies. The second part briefly describes the article's sources and method, namely militant ethnography carried out with the Kurdish Women's Movement, both in Rojava and in the European diaspora, cross-referenced with an analysis of some key texts of Jineoloji. The third part investigates the process by which the matristic perspective is being currently performed in Rojava through Jineoloji: a pedagogy for women's self-defense, the autonomous re-appropriation of communalist and ecological praxis, and men's liberation from hegemonic masculinity. We conclude that Jineoloji does not configure as a model of society to be recovered from a pre-patriarchal age, but as an original tool for liberating social potential towards gender, decolonial and ecological revolutions.","[Gea Piccardi, Eleonora] Ctr Social Studies, Rua Couraca Apostolos 11, P-3000432 Coimbra, Portugal; [Barca, Stefania] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Praza Univ 1, Santiago De Compostela 15703, Spain",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Piccardi, EG (corresponding author), Ctr Social Studies, Rua Couraca Apostolos 11, P-3000432 Coimbra, Portugal.",geapiccardi@gmail.com; stefania.barca@usc.es,,,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BD/133741/2017]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/133741/2017] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This research was funded by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Doctoral Grant no [SFRH/BD/133741/2017].",,,7,7,2,3,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This conflict is interesting because it crystallizes key questions about the future of the island. Intriguingly, all the conflicting groups of actors mobilize the same philosophy of Tri Hita Karana (THK), which can be translated as the three causes of well-being and which is said to guide the development policies of the island. Our objective is to investigate how THK relates to the conflict and to what extent some of its interpretations are growth-critical. Using political ecology as a theoretical lens and qualitative methods, we find that the conflicting groups do not oppose each other through different languages of valuation, but within them. Likewise, THK is only superficially one idiom of valuation. In reality, THK covers different visions of development, depending on the actors involved. We identify three broad ways of interpreting THK in this conflict: (i) a marketable way, (ii) an equity-oriented way, and (iii) a radical-integral way, which bears similarities with post-growth views. This article is a contribution to the emerging debates on post-growth thinking from the global South and to the radical critique of tourism industry in developing regions.","[Adityanandana, Made; Gerber, Julien-Francois] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Agr Food & Environm Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Adityanandana, M (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Agr Food & Environm Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",adityanand.ma@gmail.com,,,Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP),Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP),This study was supported by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP).,,,9,9,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

We argue that notions of degrowth present scholars with challenges as well as opportunities to reframe core assumptions and develop new directions in theory and research. Envisioning a post-COVID 19 world where societies and organizations can flourish without growth is one of the most difficult tasks facing theorists. We approach this challenge first by discussing the hegemonic properties of growth ideology and second by sketching an alternative political economy as a context for reimagining social and economic relations within planetary capacities in a post-growth era. Drawing on degrowth literature in ecological economics, sociology and political ecology, we identify key principles relevant to processes of organizing for a more just and environmentally sustainable future: frugal abundance, conviviality, care, and open relocalization.

It stands in strong opposition to mainstream thought on the operations of the economy and society. The core arguments deconstruct and oppose both growth and price-making market paradigms. However, in contradiction of these theoretical foundations, ecological economists can be found who call upon neoclassical economic theory as insightful, price-making and capitalist markets as socially justified means of allocation and economic growth as achieving progress and development. The more radical steady-state and post-growth/degrowth movements are shown to include confused and conflicted stances in relation to the mainstream hegemonic paradigms. Ecological economics personally challenges those trained in mainstream theory to move beyond their orthodox education and leave behind the flawed theories and concepts that contribute to supporting systems that create social, ecological and economic crises. This paper makes explicit the paradigmatic struggle of the past thirty years and the need to wipe away mainstream apologetics, pragmatic conformity and ill-conceived postmodern pluralism.

We outline five steps for such a programmatic, yet paradigmatic, urban degrowth agenda. These are: (1) grounding current degrowth debates within their historical-geographical context; (2) engaging (planning) institutions in linking degrowth practices to urbanisation policies; (3) examining how urban insurgent degrowth alliances can be scaled up without co-optation; (4) focusing on the role of experts and professionals in bringing degrowth principles into everyday urban practice; and (5) prefiguring how degrowth agendas can confront the diverse and unequal urban social relations and uneven outcomes in the Global North and South.","[Kaika, Maria] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Varvarousis, Angelos] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Demaria, Federico] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [March, Hug] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Kaika, Maria] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Dept Human Geog Planning & Int Dev, 1562, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; University of Amsterdam,"Kaika, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Dept Human Geog Planning & Int Dev, 1562, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.kaika@uva.nl,,,,,,,,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2023,60,7,,,SI,,1191,1211,,10.1177/00420980231162234,0,,MAR 2023,21,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,E3YM8,,hybrid,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000956702400001,0,en

With inspiration from research on ecologically unequal exchange (EUE), we demonstrate the drawbacks of present green growth strategies by considering how pollution- and resource-intensive industries are distributed unevenly in the world economy, with large and increasing negative impacts on the periphery. The situation may only be exacerbated if the reduction of emissions in the center is based on shifting heavy industries and extractive enterprises to low-cost producers in the periphery. In this way, existing research likely overemphasizes the capacity of green investment policy to achieve sustainable outcomes. Our scenarios show that achieving global sustainability and improving global equity will require an impressive level of coordination between the center and periphery, as well as a significant reduction in the rate of growth (degrowth) in the center.","[Althouse, Jeffrey] Univ Paris 13, Ctr Econ & Gest Paris Nord CEPN, Paris, France; [Guarini, Giulio] Tuscia Univ, Dept Econ Engn Soc & Business, Viterbo, Italy; [Gabriel Porcile, Jose] Econ Commiss Latin Amer & Caribbean UN ECLAC, Santiago, Chile",Universite Paris 13; Tuscia University,"Althouse, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris 13, Ctr Econ & Gest Paris Nord CEPN, Paris, France.",jeffrey.althouse@edu.univ-paris13.fr,,,European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [665850],European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors would like to thank Marc Lavoie, Ana Carolina Cordilha, Antoine Monserand, Romain Svartzman and two anonymous referees for revisions and helpful comments.

The experience of buen vivir as a State project of social transformation in Ecuador and Bolivia has evinced the fallacy of providing soloist responses to a crisis that confirms, more than ever, the fact of global interdependencies. The article provides an analysis of the potentials and limits of a discursive articulation that focuses on these interdependencies, on the basis of buen vivir, degrowth, and human development, as emblematic discourses of transition in the global South and North, and of the political liberal mainstream, respectively. The argument is built on the basis of the main contributions and structural limitations of each one of those discourses fostering a civilizational transition toward a path of global, socio-ecologically sustainable (post)development. Despite the failure of buen vivir as a political program for a Great Transition, the analysis highlights the potential for cultural transformation, implicit in the tenets and practice of alternative eco-convivial worlds at a macro-social scale. The blind spots of the discourse of buen vivir-that is, the geo-economic interdependencies deriving from a globalized matrix of production and consumption that cannot be generalized-constitute the main concern of degrowth discourses. The latter however, lack the political and cultural pull to implement the changes envisaged. Thus, the synergic circle closes with the analysis of the fertilization potential of buen vivir and degrowth on the political-cultural idea of human development, as formulated by the United Nations Development Program (undp), drawing on Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, to shift political discourse as the precondition for a fundamental transformation of political practice. With this analysis of potential intercultural discursive synergies, the article aims at providing new perspectives for a sociology committed to critique and to a socio-ecological transition toward sustainability in these times of global environmental crisis.","[Beling, Adrian E.] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales Flacso, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Beling, AE (corresponding author), Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales Flacso, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",abeling@flacso.org.ar,,,,,,,,0,0,1,4,"UNIV NACL COLOMBIA, DEPT SOCIOLOGIA",BOGOTA,"CIUDAD UNIV, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA",,,,REV COLOMB SOCIOL,Rev.

We argue that the regional decline results from a process of peripheralization which has led to economic stagnation and a shrinking population, and also has fostered political discontent. By drawing on a regional survey, an intensive case study at a manufacturing site and qualitative interviews with policy makers, managers, works council members and employees, we analyse how peripheralization has impacted labour relations and politics in a shrinking region. We discuss our findings by referring to current political sociology debates on the rise of right-wing populism and the scientific discussion on post-growth, as well as recent approaches of critical geography and development sociology. We show how feelings of injustice such as anger about low wages and the democratic void at work interlink with pessimistic assessments concerning the region's future and feelings of deprivation. We conclude that the economic model based on labour-intensive exports in the internal periphery of East German capitalism is eroding and is contributing to a crisis of hegemony and political instability.","[Schmalz, Stefan; Hasenohr, Anne] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Sociol, Jena, Germany; [Schmalz, Stefan] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Singe, Ingo] Univ Bremen, Ctr Labour & Polit Educ, Bremen, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Free University of Berlin; University of Bremen,"Schmalz, S (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Soziol, Lehrstuhl Arbeits Ind & Wirtschaftssoziol, Carl Zeiss Str 2, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",s.schmalz@uni-jena.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the 'Arbeiten-Lernen-Kompetenzen entwickeln.

The mainstream Sustainable Development discourse, however, insists in upholding the myth of compatibility of current growth-based trajectories with biophysical planetary boundaries. This article explores potentially fertile complementarities among trendy discourses challenging conventional notions of (un)sustainable development-Human Development, Degrowth, and Boon Vivir - and outlines pathways for their realization. Human Development presents relative transformative strengths in political terms, while Degrowth holds keys to unlocking unsustainable material-structural entrenchments of contemporary socio-economic arrangements, and Buen Vivir offers a space of cultural alterity and critique of the Euro-Atlantic cultural constellation. The weaknesses or blind spots ('Achilles heels') of each discourse can be compensated through the strengths of the other ones, creating a dialogical virtuous circle that would open pathways towards a global new Great Transformation. As one of the main existing platforms for pluralist and strong-sustainability discussions, Ecological Economics is in a privileged position to deliberately foster such strategic discursive dialogue. A pathway towards such dialogue is illuminated through a model identifying and articulating key discursive docking points.","[Beling, Adrian E.] FLACSO Argentina, Global Studies Programme, Tucuman 1966,C1050AAC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Vanhulst, Julien] Univ Catolica Maule, Sociol Sch, CEUT, FACSE, Campus San Miguel,Ave San Miguel 3605,Casilla 617, Talca, Chile; [Demaria, Federico] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Res & Degrowth, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rabi, Violeta] Espacio Publ Fdn, Sta Lucia 188, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Carballo, Ana E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, 420 John Medley Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Pelenc, Jerome] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IGEAT GEDD, Fonds Rech Sci FRS FNRS, Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universidad Catolica del Maule; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Melbourne; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Beling, AE (corresponding author), FLACSO Argentina, Global Studies Programme, Tucuman 1966,C1050AAC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Vanhulst, J (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Sociol Sch, CEUT, FACSE, Campus San Miguel,Ave San Miguel 3605,Casilla 617, Talca, Chile.",abeling@flacso.org.ar; julien@ucm.cl,,,Paul + Maria Kremer Foundation; FONDECYT [1160186]; European Research Council [GA 695446]; Spanish government [CSO2014-54513-R],Paul + Maria Kremer Foundation; FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Spanish government(Spanish Government),Adrian E.

The prioritization of the environmental (planet) and (arguably also the) social (people) pillar over the economic (profit) one may require a rather radical departure from assumptions of economic growth, including zero-growth or even de-growth, as argued in post-growth or ecological economics. This article asks the what if question. What if unorthodox, ecological economics got it right that post-growth or growth agnosticism is the new economic norm? What are the implications for human rights law and for the field of human rights and development? How could poverty alleviation look like in a growth agnostic scenario? The objective of this article is to draw out in an exploratory way some of the implications of strong definitions of sustainable development for human rights law and its relevance for development. At first, this intellectual exercise may look irrelevant or even cynical in the context of Africa, where more than 40% of the population, more than 300 million people, live in poverty. However, I see two major reasons for also debating in an African context the implications of growth agnosticism for human rights law. First, economic growth does not necessarily lead to economic development, let alone human development, and has typically come at a huge environmental cost. Alternative approaches that focus more directly on human well-being and ecological sustainability may help avoid a simple mimicking of the historical development of the global North. Second, ecological economics shifts the attention from growth to redistribution. The latter is a key challenge within Africa and within African countries, as well as from a global perspective. I examine how to factor in the consequences of post-growth or doughnut economics in the conceptual analysis of socio-economic human rights, and in the role of human rights law in development (cooperation), globally and nationally. In particular, I will try and set a research agenda on two issues that require further examination: the redefinition of obligations of international assistance and cooperation in human rights law and the reconceptualization of equality towards redistributive equality in human rights-based development cooperation interventions.","[Vandenhole, Wouter] Univ Antwerp, Fac Law, Law & Dev Res Grp, Venusstr 23, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Vandenhole, W (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Law, Law & Dev Res Grp, Venusstr 23, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",wouter.vandenhole@uantwerp.be,,,,,,,,11,11,2,94,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,,LAW DEV REV,Law Dev.

They both oppose extractivism and debt-fuelled economies, as well as the untrammelled profit motive which fails to incorporate full environmental and social costs. They both rely upon social movements that have led scholarship in its activities and achievements, in part through challenging power structures. Therefore, some argue the existence of an obvious alliance between degrowth and EJ movements in the Global South. Yet, direct observation unveils concerns from EJ activists in the Global South about the plausibility of alliances until some significant divergences have been examined and reconciled. Activists inspire, promote and disseminate transformations that overcome several forms of domination. Their perspectives on degrowth advance informed cooperation. Our aim is thus to systematically evaluate tensions and possible analogies between the scope of action of EJ organisations operating in the Global South and the main propositions of the Degrowth movement. The argument relies on methodical scrutiny of core themes in the degrowth debate by critical thinkers in the Global South. It incorporates insights from EJ struggles in Ecuador, Italy, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uruguay, with important implications in Brazil, Mozambique, and Indonesia. The paper contributes to an exploration of the implications of the degrowth debate for the Global South, with the purpose of strengthening potential synergies, through an assertive recognition of the barriers to doing so.","[Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yanez, Ivonne] Acc Ecol, Quito, Ecuador; [Bond, Patrick] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Greyl, Lucie] A Sud, Rome, Italy; [Munguti, Serah] Nat Kenya East Africa Nat Hist Soc, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ojo, Godwin Uyi] Environm Rights Act Friends Earth Nigeria, Ugbowo Benin, Nigeria; [Overbeek, Winfridus] World Rainforest Movement, Montevideo, Uruguay",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Witwatersrand,"Rodriguez-Labajos, B (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Barcelona, Spain.;Rodriguez-Labajos, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",beatriz.rodriguez@uab.cat,,,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence [MDM-2015-0552]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [797444]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence(Spanish Government); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","The authors are grateful to Larry Lohman, Ulrich Brand, and Federico Demaria for insightful conversations regarding the topics addressed in this paper, and Joe Herbert for proof-reading.

A logical framework to address the challenge of urban planning and management to promote long-term urban system sustainability is proposed. Systems thinking and diagramming are applied, while comprehensively tracking the key material flows upon which cities depend back to their sources. First, the nexus among resources and urban activities is identified, and then its circularity is framed within a wider discourse on urban sustainability and resilience.

Meanwhile, they are very important for understanding (evaluating) the origin, age, and post-growth conditions of natural diamonds. In the present work, an attempt was made to analyze the causes of the formation of high concentrations of N3V centers in natural IaB-type diamonds from the Kholomolokh placer (the Northeast Siberian craton). The possibility of decay of B centers during the plastic deformation of diamonds is analyzed and experiments on the high-temperature annealing of diamonds containing B centers are reported. The formation of N3V centers during the destruction of the B centers at high-pressure annealing of crystals has been established by experiment. It is assumed that, in the post-growth period, diamond crystals were exposed to tectono-thermal stages of raising the superplumes of the Earth's crust of the Siberian craton.","[Nadolinny, V.

Models seldom consider energy constraints, taking supply availability for granted and thus suggesting a mere change in the energy mix from non-renewables to renewables. In order to address these limitations, a macro-economic module within a broader system dynamics model (MEDEAS) has been developed. The model has been run for the whole world from 1995 to 2050 under three different scenarios: Business as Usual (BAU), considering no further transition policies and keeping current trends; Green Growth (GG), undertaking the low-carbon transition according to the Paris Agreement set of policies and with high GDP growth standards; and Post-Growth (PG), testing the sustainability transition under a GDP non-growth/degrowth approach. The results reveal the conflict between economic growth, climate policy and the sustainability of resources. Whereas a BAU approach would not even be an option to achieve climate goals, a GG view would not only face the downsizing of economic output, but neither would it be able to achieve the 2 degrees C objective. The success of the PG approach in meeting emissions objectives suggests a redirection from economic growth policies to an industrial policy that incorporates efficiency and redistribution.","[Nieto, Jaime; Carpintero, Oscar] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid, Spain; [Nieto, Jaime; Carpintero, Oscar; Miguel, Luis J.; de Blas, Ignacio] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Paseo Cauce S-N, Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Nieto, J (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid, Spain.",jaime.nieto@eco.uva.es,,,"European project H2020-LCE-2015-2 [691287]; MODESLOW project MODElling and Simulation of scenarios towards a LOW-carbon transition: the Spanish case); Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Program (Ministry of Economy and Innovation, Spain) [ECO2017-85110-R]","European project H2020-LCE-2015-2; MODESLOW project MODElling and Simulation of scenarios towards a LOW-carbon transition: the Spanish case); Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Program (Ministry of Economy and Innovation, Spain)","We are grateful for the support in the elaboration of this article from the European project H2020-LCE-2015-2 (691287) Guiding European Policy toward a low-carbon economy.

Yet even with broad support, we can expect ongoing shocks and events to shape the implementation of just transition agendas. In concept and practice, just transitions must directly account for and anticipate profound uncertainties regarding the social and ecological context in which such projects are planned and implemented, while breaking from growth dependence. This paper argues that the future of just transitions must center on essential care work to better ensure well-being without economic growth. The essay examines diverse perspectives on the meaning of just transition, articulating a more transformative approach under conditions of economic instability. The review demonstrates broadening understandings of just transitions, spanning from those more narrowly focused on immediate worker-and sectoral supports to those aiming for more fundamental and lasting transformations of economies and societies. Given the extreme social, economic, and ecological uncertainties of our time, the paper lastly proposes temporally overlapping agendas for policies, strategies, and institutions of just transition organized around post-growth care work. As inspired by the field of futures studies, the article contributes a set of criteria to help advance just transitions beyond fossil fuel and growth dependence.","[Burke, Matthew J.] Univ Vermont, Leadership Ecozo, 200B Farrell Hall,210 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Burke, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Leadership Ecozo, 200B Farrell Hall,210 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",matthew.burke@uvm.edu,,,Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont; Democracy Collaborative,Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont; Democracy Collaborative,"This work was supported by the Leadership for the Ecozoic partnership and the Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont, with additional support for an initial draft from the Democracy Collaborative.",,,3,3,4,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,FUTURES,Futures,FEB,2022,136,,,,,,,,102900,10.1016/j.futures.2021.102900,0,,JAN 2022,19,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1W5HU,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000806805200001,0,en

Such an approach based on an implicit re-ranking of individual incomes ignores income mobility by assuming that only post-growth income matters in social welfare. By contrast, this paper takes the view that status quo matters and that social welfare should logically be defined on both inital and terminal income. This leads to consider 'non-anonymous' Growth Incidence Curves that plot income growth rates against the various quantiles of the initial distribution. Dominance criteria that generalize those available for standard growth incidence curves are derived, which account for the inequality of individual income changes, conditional on initial income. An application to the cross-country distributional feature of global growth illustrates the analysis.","Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Bourguignon, F (corresponding author), Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",francois.bourguignon@parisschoolofeconomics.eu,,,,,,,,40,41,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Since the global financial crisis, a variety of theories attempting to explain the slow recovery of the global economy have predicted that future economic growth will be slower than in the past. Others have increasingly questioned whether GDP growth is desirable or sustainable in the long term as evidence grows of humanity's impact on the natural environment. This paper reviews recent data on trends in global GDP growth and health expenditure. It examines a range of theories and scenarios concerning future global GDP growth prospects. It then considers the potential implications for health care systems and health financing policy of these different scenarios. In all cases, a core question concerns whether growth in GDP and/or growth in health expenditure in fact increases human health and well-being. Health care systems in low growth or 'post-growth' futures will need to be much more tightly focused on reducing overtreatment and low value care, reducing environmental impact, and on improving technical and allocative efficiency. This will require much more concerted policy and regulatory action to reduce industry rent-seeking behaviours.","[Hensher, Martin] Deakin Univ, Deakin Hlth Econ, Bldg BC3,221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Tisdell, John] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Canny, Ben] Univ Tasmania, Sch Med, Private Bag 34, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Zimitat, Craig] Curtin Univ, Curtin Learning & Teaching, Perth, WA 6150, Australia",Deakin University; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Curtin University,"Hensher, M (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Deakin Hlth Econ, Bldg BC3,221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",martin.hensher@deakin.edu.au,,,Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.,,,10,10,5,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",,,,HEALTH ECON POLICY L,Health Econ.

The pursuit of 'development' has been a key hallmark of the modern idea of progress. Long-standing critiques of the socio-ecological and other adverse impacts of development have not made much headway in effecting meaningful change. Engaging with this impasse, I argue that specific zoopolitical notions of human wellbeing that are co-constitutive with developmentality are at the foundation of today's socio-ecological troubles and multispecies justice concerns. Bringing together post-development and animal studies scholarship, I discuss the twinned logics of protection-sacrifice that underlie the pursuit of human wellbeing at societal scales, and that have come to characterise more-than-human responses as well. I build on this, in conversation with environmental philosopher Val Plumwood and degrowth scholar Giorgos Kallis, to suggest that achieving multispecies justice requires a renewed focus on the human in the form of a fundamental re-placement of the social in the rest of the nature. To this end, I offer thought experiments on re-visioning wellbeing via an approach of 're-animalisation' to provoke reflection on crafting new foundations for equitable multispecies presents and futures.","[Srinivasan, Krithika] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Geog, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Srinivasan, K (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Geog, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",K.srinivasan@ed.ac.uk,,,Royal Society of Edinburgh's Sabbatical Research Grant [65100],Royal Society of Edinburgh's Sabbatical Research Grant,The research and writing for this paper were supported by the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Sabbatical Research Grant (grant number 65100).,,,2,2,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,SOCIOL REV,Sociol.

Furthermore, an effective solution for global challenges must go beyond behavioural or national strategies and be structural at the global level.

Here, the authors present a systematic characterization of the structure and stability of oxygen-terminated diamond (110) surfaces. Diamond-based materials have unique properties that are exploited in many electrochemical, optical, thermal, and quantum applications. When grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the growth rate of the (110) face is typically much faster than the other two dominant crystallographic orientations, (111) and (100). As such, achieving sufficiently large-area and high-quality (110)-oriented crystals is challenging and typically requires post-growth processing of the surface. Whilst CVD growth confers hydrogen terminations on the diamond surface, the majority of post-growth processing procedures render the surface oxygen-terminated, which in turn impacts the surface properties of the material. Here, we determine the oxygenation state of the (110) surface using a combination of density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. We show that in the 0-1000 K temperature range, the phase diagram of the (110) surface is dominated by a highly stable phase of coexisting and adjacent carbonyl and ether groups, while the stability of peroxide groups increases at low temperatures and high pressures. We propose a mechanism for the formation of the hybrid carbonyl-ether phase and rationalize its high stability. We further corroborate our findings by comparing simulated core-level binding energies with experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data on the highest-quality (110)-oriented diamond crystal surface reported to date.","[Chaudhuri, Shayantan; Hall, Samuel J.; Klein, Benedikt P.; Macpherson, Julie, V; Maurer, Reinhard J.] Univ Warwick, Dept Chem, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Chaudhuri, Shayantan] Univ Warwick, Ctr Doctoral Training Diamond Sci & Technol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Hall, Samuel J.] Univ Warwick, Ctr Doctoral Training Mol Analyt Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Klein, Benedikt P.] Harwell Sci & Innovat Campus, Diamond Light Source, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Walker, Marc] Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Logsdail, Andrew J.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Catalysis Inst, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales",University of Warwick; University of Warwick; University of Warwick; Diamond Light Source; University of Warwick; Cardiff University,"Macpherson, JV; Maurer, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Chem, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.macpherson@warwick.ac.uk; r.maurer@warwick.ac.uk,,,"EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Diamond Science and Technology [EP/L015315/1]; EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Molecular Analytical Science [EP/L015307/1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KL 3430/1-1]; UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship program [MR/T018372/1, MR/S016023/1]; EPSRC Engineered Diamond Technologies program [EP/V056778/1]; EPSRC [EP/P020232/1, EP/R029431/1]; EPSRC [EP/V056778/1] Funding Source: UKRI; UKRI [MR/T018372/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Diamond Science and Technology(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Molecular Analytical Science(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship program(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC Engineered Diamond Technologies program(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); UKRI(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This work was funded by the EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Diamond Science and Technology [EP/L015315/1] (S.C.), the EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Molecular Analytical Science [EP/L015307/1] (S.J.H.), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KL 3430/1-1] (B.P.K.), the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship program [MR/T018372/1 and MR/S016023/1] (A.J.L. and R.J.M. respectively) and the EPSRC Engineered Diamond Technologies program [EP/V056778/1] (J.V.M).

Defects of various kinds can be observed. The present study is a review of topographic results obtained in the X-ray laboratory of the Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Warsaw, for three families of single crystals grown by the Czochralski method: (i) silicon (Si) and Si1-xGex, (ii) selected binary REVO4 oxides and (iii) selected ternary ABCO(4) oxides. The effect of chemical composition, growth conditions and post growth thermal annealing on the defect appearing in crystals is discussed. Various defects are revealed: the growth dislocations (some early Si crystals), the composition-gradient-induced lattice deformation (Si1-xGex, solid solutions CaxSr1-xNdAlO4), defects generated in Si after the post growth thermal processes, oriented elongated rod-like macro-defects tending to form networks within the crystal core, cellular structure in the outer shell (SrLaGaO4), and variously developed block structure (in selected binary REVO4 crystals).","[Lefeld-Sosnowska, M.] Univ Warsaw, Inst Expt Phys, PL-00681 Warsaw, Poland; [Malinowska, A.] Inst Elect Mat Technol, PL-01919 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Institute of Electronic Materials Technology,"Malinowska, A (corresponding author), Inst Elect Mat Technol, Wolczynska 133, PL-01919 Warsaw, Poland.",agnieszka.malinowska@itme.edu.pl,,,,,,,,2,2,0,5,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST PHYSICS,WARSAW,"AL LOTNIKOW 32-46, PL-02-668 WARSAW, POLAND",,,,ACTA PHYS POL A,Acta Phys.

J,"Escobar, A",,,,"Escobar, Arturo",,,"Degrowth, postdevelopment, and transitions: a preliminary conversation",SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE,,,English,Review,,,,,,Degrowth; Postdevelopment; Transitions; Civilizational crisis; Global South,,"This paper seeks to initiate a conversation between degrowth (DG) and postdevelopment (PD) frameworks by placing them within the larger field of discourses for ecological and civilizational transitions and by bridging proposals emerging from the North with those from the Global South. Not only can this dialogue, it is argued, be mutually enriching for both movements but perhaps essential for an effective politics of transformation. Part I of the paper presents a brief panorama of transition discourses (TDs), particularly in the North. Part II discusses succinctly the main postdevelopment trends in Latin America, including Buen Vivir (BV), the rights of Nature, civilizational crisis, and the concept of 'alternatives to development'. With these elements in hand, Part III attempts a preliminary dialogue between degrowth and postdevelopment, identifying points of convergence and tension; whereas they originate in somewhat different intellectual traditions and operate through different epistemic and political practices, they share closely connected imaginaries, goals, and predicaments, chiefly, a radical questioning of the core assumption of growth and economism, a vision of alternative worlds based on ecological integrity and social justice, and the ever present risk of cooptation. Important tensions remain, for instance, around the critique of modernity and the scope for dematerialization. This part ends by outlining areas of research on PD that could be of particular interest to degrowth scholars. The conclusion, finally, envisions the dissolution of the very binary of 'Global North' and 'Global South' by adopting a pluriversal perspective.","[Escobar, Arturo] Univ N Carolina, Dept Anthropol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Escobar, Arturo] Univ Valle, Grp Invest Nac Cultura Memoria, Cali, Colombia",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Universidad del Valle,"Escobar, A (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Anthropol, CB 3115, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",aescobar@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,,204,207,5,84,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

To date, most IPE scholars of the RE transition assume that renewables will simply substitute for fossil fuels and thereby continue similar patterns of economic growth and military competition that have characterized world politics over the past two centuries. However, they do not systematically consider what I call the 'non-substitutability hypothesis,' or the view that renewables will be unable to substitute for many of the services that fossil fuels provide for economies and militaries. In contrast, I will argue that if the non-substitutability hypothesis is correct, then a fully decarbonized global political economy would require a 'Great Transformation,' or a structural transformation in the political-economic and military bases of world order. In particular, I suggest that this would require two conjoined transitions: 1) a transition towards a 'post-growth' global political economy, or an economy that does not depend on continuous annual increases in GDP; and 2) a shift towards 'demilitarization,' in the sense of 'leaner' low-energy force structures; weakening pressure for military arms racing; and a transformation in national security priorities to focus on climate mitigation, adaptation, and disaster response.","[Albert, Michael J.] SOAS Univ London, Polit & Int Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Albert, MJ (corresponding author), SOAS Univ London, Polit & Int Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England.",ma158@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,,3,3,6,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The emission of single wire LEDs with the same conformal contact geometry as the array device exhibits the same broadening as the array LED electroluminescence, which proves an excellent wire-to-wire homogeneity. The electroluminescence spectra present two peaks corresponding to the m-plane InGaN quantum well (blue emission) and to an In-rich region at the m-plane-semipolar plane junction (green emission), in agreement with structural characterizations. Modification of the contact layout and a post-growth plasma treatment enable strongly suppressing the unwanted green electroluminescence while increasing the intensity in the blue spectral range for the same injected electrical power. Electron beam induced current mapping proves the inhibition of the electrical activity of the top part of the nanowire after plasma treatment. Inductively coupled plasma etching of the In-rich region permits one to completely remove the green emission for all injection currents, but loss of intensity in the blue spectral range is observed.

This paper advances a systematization of various currents of growth critiques in historical perspective. Going beyond standard accounts, it demonstrates that next to a narrow and mainly ecological critique of growth, which emerged starting in the 1950s and criticized GDP accounting and growth as a policy goal, there were also broader critiques of the phenomenon of growth itself, which emerged already since at least the eighteenth century and criticize the phenomenon of economic growth itself. To substantiate this argument, eight currents of growth critiques are analysed by focusing on their core arguments and historical trajectories: ecological, socio-economic, feminist, South-North, cultural, anti-capitalist, critique of industrialization, as well as reactionary growth criticism.","[Schmelzer, Matthias] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Sociol, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Schmelzer, M (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Sociol, Jena, Germany.",matthias.schmelzer@uni-jena.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [031B0749],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The work for this paper was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the work of the junior research group `Mentalities in Flux' (flumen) (2019-2024, grant number 031B0749).",,,0,0,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,APR 3,2023,20,3,,,,,447,464,,10.1080/14747731.2022.2106044,0,,AUG 2022,18,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,D3WD4,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000841103600001,0,en

The InN thin films, having relative high crystal quality, were grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on c-sapphire substrates using InGaN/GaN buffer layers. HRXRD reveals that oxidation of wurtzite InN into body-center cubic In2O3 occurred at elevated temperatures. A Si3N4 encapsulation improves the crystal quality of In2O3 oxidized by using conventional rapid thermal annealing (RTA) but it results in the presence of undesired metallic indium. Cycle-RTA not only improves the crystal quality but also avoids the byproduct of metallic indium. SIMS depth profile, using contaminate elements as the 'interface markers,' provide evidence that the oxidation of InN is dominated by oxygen inward diffusion mechanism. Together with the HRXRD results, we conclude that the crystal quality of the resultant In2O3/InN heterostructure is mainly controlled by the balance between the speeds of oxygen diffusion and InN thermal dissociation, which can be effectively tuned by cycle-RTA. The obtained In2O3/InN heterostructures can be fundamental materials for studying high speed chemical/gas sensing devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Liu, H. F.; Yakovlev, N.

This paper examines how small food businesses grow and develop within grassroot economies that operate on different market mechanisms. Focusing on artisan food producers and farmers' markets, this research highlights the potential of resilient, small-scale, diverse markets as pathways to sustainable food systems. An applied critical realist, mixed-methods study was conducted at a macro (Irish food industry), meso (farmers' markets in the region of Munster, Ireland) and micro (artisan food producers and their businesses) level. The resulting framework provides a post-growth perspective to sustainability, proposing that farmers' markets represent an alternative market structure to the dominant industrial market, organised on mechanisms where producers 'Mind what they make' and 'Make peace with enough'. In their resilience, these markets can provide pathways for structural change. This implies a call to action to reorientate policies targeting small food businesses to move beyond the concept of firms as profit-maximizing enterprises and to instead focus on a local food policy framework that reinforces the regional 'interstices' within which small food businesses operate to promote diversity, resilience and sustainability in the food system.","[Connolly, Richael; Bogue, Joe; Repar, Lana] Cork Univ, Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Business Sch, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland",University College Cork,"Connolly, R (corresponding author), Cork Univ, Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Business Sch, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland.",richaelconnolly@umail.ucc.ie,,,Irish Research Council [GOIPG/2020/1305],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","This research was funded by Irish Research Council, grant number GOIPG/2020/1305.",,,2,2,3,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,11626,10.3390/su141811626,0,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4U8DF,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000859017400001,0,en

We propose a novel method for quantifying national responsibility for ecological breakdown by assessing nations' cumulative material use in excess of equitable and sustainable boundaries. Methods For this analysis, we derived national fair shares of a sustainable resource corridor. These fair shares were then subtracted from countries' actual resource use to determine the extent to which each country has overshot its fair share over the period 1970-2017. Through this approach, each country's share of responsibility for global excess resource use was calculated. Findings High-income nations are responsible for 74% of global excess material use, driven primarily by the USA (27%) and the EU-28 high-income countries (25%). China is responsible for 15% of global excess material use, and the rest of the Global South (ie, the low-income and middle-income countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia) is responsible for only 8%. Overshoot in higher-income nations is driven disproportionately by the use of abiotic materials, whereas in lower-income nations it is driven disproportionately by the use of biomass. Interpretation These results show that high-income nations are the primary drivers of global ecological breakdown and they need to urgently reduce their resource use to fair and sustainable levels. Achieving sufficient reductions will likely require high-income nations to adopt transformative post-growth and degrowth approaches. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that a deeper understanding of democracy is needed to foster just transitions. First, we present a multi-dimensional understanding of justice in transitions and relate it to scholarship on democratizing transitions. Then, we argue that three paradigm shifts are required to overcome current unsustainable dynamics: (1) from expert toward pluralist understandings of knowledge; (2) from economic materialism toward post-growth strategies; and (3) from anthropocentrism toward reconnecting human-nature relationships. We explicate what these paradigm shifts entail for democratizing transitions from distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice perspectives. Finally, we highlight six challenges to institutionalizing deep democratic governance. These entail balancing tensions between: multiple justice dimensions, democracy and urgency, top-down and bottom-up directionalities, local and global scales, realism and idealism, and roles of incumbent scientific systems. This requires thoroughly rethinking transition studies' normative and democratic ambitions.","[Tschersich, Julia] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, Vening Meinesz Bldg,Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kok, Kristiaan P.

Degrowth, multi-species conviviality and the micro-politics of cultured meat",ANTHROPOLOGICAL THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Degrowth; conviviality; cultured meat; science and technology studies; micro-politics,TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES; ACCEPTANCE; POLITICS; ETHICS; GROWTH,"To address the relationship between the crises of capitalist growth and democratic politics, this paper discusses the notions of degrowth and conviviality. Both concepts are often interpreted as making similar proposals in response to questions of environmental transformation. However, they bear on different strands of critique. While degrowth criticizes the momentum of capitalist accumulation, conviviality originates in the search for alternatives to the instrumental use of technologies in industrial societies. Although these two rationalities predominantly go hand in hand in the development of modern societies, they are sometimes in conflict and different strategies are required to deal with their consequences. Therefore, the differences between degrowth and conviviality should not be obscured. Instead of using the concepts in an ethical or moral fashion as normative claims directed at some diffuse agency of states, companies and the people, the paper argues for a thorough examination of issues and propositions to overcome the environmental crisis from the perspective of materialist science and technology studies. Since one key factor here is the level of global production and consumption of meat, this paper turns toward a controversial attempt to break new ground in meat production: the vision of artificially producing meat in the laboratory. Lab-grown, cultured meat provides a powerful case study for exploring political and democratic challenges of post-growth societies, all the more so as questions of animal welfare and interspecies conviviality are addressed as well. By taking a closer look at the role of animals in proposed solutions for degrowth and conviviality in meat production and consumption, the complementarity of such claims can be questioned, and a light can be shed on the inherent political implications of such technological innovations.","[Gertenbach, Lars] Univ Kassel, FB 05 Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Lamla, Joern] Univ Kassel, Social Theory, Kassel, Germany; [Lamla, Joern] Univ Kassel, Res Ctr Informat Syst Design ITeG, Kassel, Germany; [Laser, Stefan] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Social Sci, Bochum, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel; Ruhr University Bochum,"Gertenbach, L (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, FB 05 Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",lars.gertenbach@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,,6,6,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,ANTHROPOL THEOR,Anthropol.

The infrared measurements showed the low nitrogen content (> 50 of 87 diamonds from this locality were nitrogen free and belonged to type IIa) and simultaneously the extremely high level of nitrogen aggregation (pure type IaB being predominant), which indicates that diamonds under study might have formed under high pressure and temperature conditions. In most cases, PL features excited at various wavelengths (313, 473, and 532 nm) were indicative of different growth and post-growth processes during which PL centers could be formed via interaction between vacancies and nitrogen atoms. The overall presence of the 490.7 nm, H3, and H4 centers in the luminescence spectra attests to strong plastic deformations in these diamonds. The neutral vacancy known as the GR1 center has probably occurred in a number of crystals due to radiation damage in the post-growth period. The 558.5 nm PL center is found to be one of the most common defects in type IIa samples which is accompanied by the EPR center with g-factor of 2.00285. The 536 and 576 nm vibronic systems totally dominated the PL spectra of superdeep diamonds, while none of normal diamonds from the Mir pipe (Yakutia) with similar nitrogen characteristics showed the latter three PL centers.","[Yuryeva, Olga P.; Rakhmanova, Mariana I.; Nadolinny, Vladimir A.; Komarovskikh, Andrey Yu.] Nikolaev Inst Inorgan Chem SB RAS, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Zedgenizov, Dmitry A.; Shatsky, Vladislav S.] VS Sobolev Inst Geol & Mineral SB RAS, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Zedgenizov, Dmitry A.; Shatsky, Vladislav S.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Shatsky, Vladislav S.] AP Vinogradov Inst Geochem SB RAS, Irkutsk 664033, Russia; [Kagi, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Geochem Res Ctr, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Russian Academy of Sciences; Nikolaev Institute of Inorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Sobolev Institute of Geology & Mineralogy of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Novosibirsk State University; Irkutsk Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences; A.P.

Parks in the coastal mega cities of Metro Manila and Chennai can be seen as relics of a colonial era, and spaces coherent with capitalist, growth-oriented and consumerist logics. At the same time, however, they become spaces that prefigure alternative ways of organising social life in the city based upon values of conviviality, care and sharing. Using qualitative methods of analysis, this paper examines what practices people engage with to satisfy their everyday needs in parks, but also the dynamics of exclusion and contestation that play out in these spaces. In doing so, we evaluate when and under what conditions park-making supports practices of de-growth and commoning beyond consumerist culture. Both commoning and uncommoning practices are detailed, revealing the role of provisioning systems that lead to the satisfaction of needs for some at the expense of others. Further, writing from cities that are highly unequal, and where the basic needs of many are yet to be met, we assert that understanding how degrowth manifests in these contexts can only be revealed through a situated urban political ecology approach. Spatialising degrowth in cities of the Global South should start with a focus on everyday practices, study power relationally and explore the scope for a radical incrementalism.","[Anantharaman, Manisha] St Marys Coll Calif, Moraga, CA USA; [Sahakian, Marlyne] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Saloma, Czarina] Ateneo Manila Univ, Quezon City, Philippines",Saint Mary's College of California; University of Geneva; Ateneo de Manila University,"Sahakian, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Sociol Dept, 40 Blvd Pont Arve, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",marlyne.sahakian@unige.ch,,,Swiss Network for International Studies; SNIS,Swiss Network for International Studies; SNIS,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article <EM><STRONG> </STRONG></EM>draws from a research project funded by the Swiss Network for International Studies, co-coordinated by Marlyne Sahakian and Antonietta Di Giulio.

Daly has played a key role in advancing the critique of economic growth, helping launch the field of ecological economics, and creating a foundation for many variations of post-growth thinking. This commentary examines some of Daly's main contributions that have included elaborating the idea that growth can be uneconomic, outlining core principles of a steady-state economy, questioning the potential to decouple economic growth from environmental impacts, advancing the project of moving beyond gross domestic product (GDP) to measure economic performance, and emphasizing the importance of separately addressing the economy's optimal scale, just distribution, and efficient allocation. Also discussed are controversial elements of Daly's work, including his population and immigration proposals. While mainstream economists have resisted these ideas, the most important criticisms come from people sympathetic with his challenge to the growth paradigm, including criticism of insufficient analysis of how the dynamics of contemporary capitalist economies drive a relentless pursuit of growth. As Victor argues, it is time for a new generation to build on the foundations that Daly constructed. Much work still lies ahead in creating an economy appropriate for a full world, including better understanding of how to reduce growth dependency and creating the complementary cultural and political changes needed to overcome opposition.","[Hayden, Anders] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hayden, Anders] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 6299 South St,Room 358,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Hayden, A (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 6299 South St,Room 358,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",anders.hayden@dal.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-SCI P,Sustainability-Sci.

The effects of different Ga-doping concentrations on the CdTe:Ga coupled with different post-growth treatments were studied by analysing the structural, optical, morphological and electronic properties of the deposited layers using x-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy, photoelectrochemical cell measurement and direct-current conductivity test respectively. XRD results show diminishing (111)C CdTe peak above 20 ppm Ga-doping and the appearance of (301)M GaTe diffraction above 50 ppm Ga-doping indicating the formation of two phases; CdTe and GaTe. Although, reductions in the absorption edge slopes were observed above 20 ppm Ga-doping for the as-deposited CdTe:Ga layer, no obvious influence on the energy gap of CdTe films with Ga-doping were detected. Morphologically, reductions in grain size were observed at 50 ppm Ga-doping and above with high pinhole density within the layer.

In Europe, the concept of degrowth is gaining in importance as a strategy to reorient societies and create well-being against the imperatives of capitalist growth. In Latin America, there is a post-extractivism or good living critique of the currently dominant development model of neo-extractivism. Only recently a dialogue between these two debates has started. This is surprising, because the chances to realize degrowth and post-extractivist strategies depend on global social-ecological transformations. Moreover, the debates are not linked to the inclusive development framework. This review article assesses both debates and discusses their strengths and shortcomings and makes suggestions for the concept of inclusive development.","[Brand, Ulrich; Boos, Tobias; Brad, Alina] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Brand, U (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria.",ulrich.brand@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,,23,24,2,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

However, it is the first to possess all three of these attributes simultaneously. For this reason, the Bristol Pound has been heralded by some as marking a new era for local currency-driven localisation. To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g. support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC. We therefore suggest that those pursuing localisation should engage in a more active agenda that aims to change government policy and institutions to support an equitable, sustainable economy.","[Marshall, Adam P.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [O'Neill, Daniel W.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds,"Marshall, AP (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",a.marshall@mmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,,19,19,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This article looks at how tourism initiatives under a BV approach can lead to degrowth by drawing on a case study of how BV is put into practice through tourism in the Cotacachi County in Ecuador. We argue that by degrowing socially and environmentally damaging extractive sectors and growing alternative economic activities like community-based tourism, a BV approach could increase social and environmental wellbeing. We refer to LaTouche's notion of degrowth as a matrix of multiple alternatives that will reopen the space for human creativity. This complements the notion of BV as a plural approach, and in turn works to decolonise the parameters of how we might understand degrowth. In the case of Cotacachi, the vision for tourism is based on the needs of the community, rather than to satisfy a Eurocentric ideal of development supported by a policy of extractivism. BV is key to how this community conceptualises the potentialities of tourism because it considers the wellbeing of the people and the environment. In this case, degrowth is a consequence of BV, rather than the objective.","[Chassagne, Natasha] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Social Impact, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia; [Everingham, Phoebe] Univ Newcastle, Dept Human Geog, Newcastle, NSW, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; University of Newcastle,"Chassagne, N (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Social Impact, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia.",nchassagne@swin.edu.au,,,,,,,,34,35,4,25,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",,,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

However, the barriers to building a broader de growth movement appear to be very entrenched at present. To improve the political feasibility of degrowth it is important to better understand these structural obstacles and develop arguments and strategies to address them. To contribute to the degrowth debate we focus in this paper on current generations in rich countries and their concerns about possible short- to medium term wellbeing outcomes of degrowth. In particular, we highlight the 'growth lock-in' of current societies and how a transition away from this model might therefore affect wellbeing. We also argue that taking the basic human needs framework as a new 'measuring rod' for wellbeing outcomes is suitable for a degrowth context, but likely to clash with people's current expectations of ever improving health and wellbeing outcomes. We propose that deliberative forums on future needs satisfaction can help establish a 'dialogue' between current and future generations which could support cultural shifts on wellbeing thinking which will be much needed for advancing the cause for degrowth.","[Buchs, Milena] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Koch, Max] Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Socialhogskolan, Box 23, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds; Lund University,"Buchs, M (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.m.buchs@leeds.ac.uk; max.koch@soch.lu.se,,,FORMAS (Swedish Research Council FORMAS) project The New Urban Challenge?

By means of dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we compared the parallel stretching processes between the initially bulk amorphous and semicrystalline polymers at various temperatures. In the early stage of stretching, semicrystalline polymers perform local and global melting-recrystallization behaviors at low and high temperatures, while the memory effects occur upon global melting-recrystallization at middle temperatures. However, the final crystallinities, crystalline bond orientations, chain-folding probabilities, residual stresses, and crystallite morphologies at high enough strains appear as the same at each temperature, irrelevant to the initially amorphous and semicrystalline polymers, indicating that the common post-growth melting-reorganization processes determine the final products. In addition, both final products harvest the highest crystallinities in the middle temperature region because the postgrowth stage yields the vast nuclei followed with less extent of crystal growth in the low temperature region and few nuclei followed with large extent of crystal growth in the high temperature region. Our observations imply that a large enough strain can effectively remove the thermal history of polymers, similar to the thermal treatment at a high enough temperature; therefore, the fracture strength of semicrystalline polymers depends upon their final structures in stretching, not related to their nascent semicrystalline structures.

The Smart City encapsulates all the desires and prospects on the transformative and disruptive role technology will have in solving urban issues both in Global North and Global South cities. Critical scholarship has pointed out that private capital, with the blessing of technocratic elites, has found a techno-environmental fix to both reshuffle economic growth and prevent other alternative politico-ecological transitions to take root in urban systems. Against this bleak outlook, the paper argues that these technological assemblages might be compatible with alternative post-capitalist urban transformations aligned with Degrowth. Through a cross-reading of research on Smart Cities with theoretical perspectives drawn from the literature on Degrowth, I suggest that Degrowth should not refrain from engaging with urban technological imaginaries in a critical and selective way. As the paper shows through alternative uses of Smart technologies and digital open-source fabrication, the question is not so much around technology per se but around the wider politico economic context into which these technological assemblages are embedded.

To explore the origin of the magnetism of nanosized antiferromagnetic (AFM) manganites, a comparative study has been conducted for CaMn3O6 (CMO-1) and post-growth vacuum annealed (CMO-2) nanoribbons. A lattice expansion resulting from oxygen release during vacuum annealing is observed. Correspondingly, AFM ordering in CMO-2 is further suppressed, and ferromagnetism and spin-glass (SG)-like behavior are significantly enhanced, which are presumed attributable to the intrinsic structural distortions induced by oxygen vacancies. In this case, side and surface effects are not decisive factors. In addition, this study provided observations of the exchange bias effect in manganite nanoribbons with an AFM-SG-like-ferromagnetic (FM) structure, as compared with the typical AFM-core-FM-shell.

While this metaphor has been subject to discursive and ideological critique within media, communication and cultural studies, this article conducts a materialist analysis of the connections between data and oil. While claims that data is the new oil typically assume digital technologies to be clean, renewable and sustainable, an infrastructural approach reveals the vast quantities of oil and other fossil fuels necessary for digital capitalism, therefore repudiating claims that data can grow exponentially with no material costs. Consequently, the article explores how metabolic rifts and degrowth offer productive frameworks for outlining the contours of a sustainable and equitable digital future.","[Taffel, Sy] Massey Univ, Polit Ecol Res Ctr, Aotearoa, New Zealand",Massey University,"Taffel, S (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Room 4-64,Sir Geoffrey Peren Bldg,Tiritea Rd, Palmerston North 4410, Manawatu, New Zealand.",s.a.taffel@massey.ac.nz,,,,,,,,8,8,6,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAY,2023,25,5,,,,,980,998,14614448211017888,10.1177/14614448211017887,0,,JUN 2021,19,Communication,,Communication,F8OT8,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000658462000001,0,en

Post-growth thermal annealing of such NWs is often involved during device fabrication and can also be used to improve their optical and transport properties. However, effects of such annealing on alloy disorder and strain in core/shell NWs are not fully understood. In this work we investigate these effects in novel core/shell/shell GaAs/GaNAs/GaAs NWs grown by molecular beam epitaxy on (111) Si substrates. By employing polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we show that annealing (i) improves overall alloy uniformity due to suppressed long-range fluctuations in the N composition; (ii) reduces local strain within N clusters acting as quantum dot emitters; and (iii) leads to partial relaxation of the global strain caused by the lattice mismatch between GaNAs and GaAs. Our results, therefore, underline applicability of such treatment for improving optical quality of NWs from highly-mismatched alloys. They also call for caution when using ex-situ annealing in strain-engineered NW heterostructures.","[Balagula, Roman M.; Jansson, Mattias; Stehr, Jan E.; Chen, Weimin M.; Buyanova, Irina A.] Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Yukimune, Mitsuki; Ishikawa, Fumitaro] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan",Linkoping University; Ehime University,"Jansson, M (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",mattias.jansson@liu.se,,,"Swedish Energy Agency [P40119-1]; Swedish Research Council [2015-05532]; Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT) [JA2014-5698]; Swedish Government Strategic Research Area in Materials Science on Functional Materials at Linkoping University [2009 00971]; KAKENHI from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16H05970, 23686004]; Kato Foundation for Promotion of Science; Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation; Murata Science Foundation; Linkoping University","Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT); Swedish Government Strategic Research Area in Materials Science on Functional Materials at Linkoping University; KAKENHI from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Kato Foundation for Promotion of Science; Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation; Murata Science Foundation; Linkoping University","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Swedish Energy Agency (Grant No. P40119-1), the Swedish Research Council (Grant No. 2015-05532) and the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT) (Grant No. JA2014-5698).

The growth parameters were selectively varied to achieve various stages of growth for studying their effects on the morphology and microstructures of the nanowires (NWs). The SLS growth of SiNWs is discussed in the context of the experimental conditions used. Straight NWs of large aspect ratios, good crystallinity and morphology were generally obtained at a growth temperature of 1000 degrees C along with some worm-like amorphous structures. Te-Si NW core-shell structures were subsequently obtained via post-growth galvanic displacement of the SiNWs in an acidic HF electrolyte containing HTeO2+ ions. The core-shell structures obtained were decorated with Te nanoparticles. This increases the NW surface areas and should have great potential in non-reflecting, photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications. Growth study on the SiNWs and Te-Si core-shell structures is presented using various microscopy, diffraction and probe based techniques for structural, morphological and chemical characterisations.","[Ng, I.

Self-assembled bottom-up fabrication is attractive to overcome the technological challenges involved in a top-down approach, but it needs post-growth investigations in order to understand the self-organization process. We investigate the QD formation by selfsegregation in AlxGa1-xAs shells as a function of thickness and cross-section morphology. By analysing light emission from several hundreds of emitters, we find that there is a certain thickness threshold for the observation of the QDs. The threshold becomes smaller if a thin AlAs layer is pre-deposited between the GaAs nanowire core and the AlxGa1-xAs shell.

It is found that in GaNP H incorporation leads to activation of new defects, which has a Ga interstitial (Ga-i) atom at its core and may also involve a H atom as a partner. The observed activation critically depends on the presence of N in the alloy, as it does not occur in GaP with a low level of N doping. In sharp contrast, in GaNAs hydrogen is found to efficiently passivate Ga-i-related defects present in the as-grown material. A possible mechanism responsible for the observed difference in the H behavior in GaNP and GaNAs is discussed. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

We show that the NV density can be controlled by the implantation dose without necessitating increase of the nitrogen incorporation. By implanting a large C-12 dose through nanoscale apertures, we can localize an individual NV center within a volume of (similar to 180 nm)(3) at a deterministic position while repeatedly preserving a coherence time (T-2) > 300 mu s. This deterministic position control of coherent NV centers enables integration into NV-based nanostructures to realize scalable spin-sensing devices as well as coherent spin coupling mediated by photons and phonons.

The point C-Al and complex carbon-related defects, such as C-i-V-Al, and C-Al-V-O with lower formation energies should play a role of electron acceptors that compete with oxygen vacancies for electron capture.

Instead, most approaches within these literatures follow what I call a continuationist bias, which assumes that past trends of economic growth and inter-capitalist competition will continue indefinitely into the future. I identify three key reasons for this assumption: 1) a lack of engagement with evidence that meeting the Paris Agreement targets is incompatible with continuous economic growth; 2) an underestimation of the possibility that failure to meet these targets will unleash irreversible tipping points in the earth system, and 3) limited consideration of the ways climate change will converge with economic stagnation, financial instability, and food system vulnerabilities to intensify systemic risks to the global economy in the near-term and especially later this century. I argue that IR scholars should therefore explore the potential for 'post-growth' world orders to stabilize the climate system, consider how world order may adapt to a three or four degree world if Paris Agreement targets are exceeded, and investigate the possible dynamics of global 'collapse' in case runaway climate change overwhelms collective adaptation capacities during this century.","[Albert, Michael J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Albert, MJ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,,14,14,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CAMB REV INT AFF,Camb.

Economic growth is one reason for this: its impacts can lead to deforestation and put tremendous harvesting pressure on forests. In light of increasingly popular - and growth-based - bio-economy strategies, the need for more wood is likely to accelerate. Degrowth, in contrast, rejects economic growth as the central economic principle, arguing that the material throughput of countries in the Global North must shrink to achieve global sustainability. Although the concept has gained importance, there have been no attempts to link degrowth with the forest sector. This article argues that degrowth principles are beneficial for basing the forest sector on sustainable grounds, while the degrowth movement also needs to define its relationship to the forest. Against this backdrop, this contribution sets the cornerstone by linking the Swiss forest sector to central degrowth principles, and discussing possible interrelations and mismatches. Finally, a future research agenda for degrowth and the forest sector is presented.","[Creutzburg, Leonard] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Nat Resource Policy Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Creutzburg, Leonard] Univ Zurich, Econ Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich,"Creutzburg, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Nat Resource Policy Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Creutzburg, L (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Econ Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",cleonard@ethz.ch,,,,,,,,1,1,1,1,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

It views economic growth is an ideology and structural interest of the capitalist state, one that serves the interests of a specific class or elite rather than, beyond a threshold, the interests of a majority in society. The article outlines some of the historical and institutional origins of economic growth as a core state imperative. It focuses on the immediate post-WW2 period, the Cold War, and the role of the OECD (and its predecessor the OEEC) in systematically disseminating and promoting GDP growth in Western European countries as a key part of the US led competition of the 'free capitalist world' against the Communist bloc. The article suggests that economic growth is s a powerful idea that has become a keystone of the (initially Keynesian-based) political ideology of growth, which in turn enabled and empowered state and supra-state institutions, and acted as a legitimating ideology throughout capitalist societies.","[Barry, John] Queens Univ Belfast, Green Polit Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Queens University Belfast,"Barry, J (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Green Polit Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.barry@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,,,14,14,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

An archetypal application of green economy is transnational trade in ecosystem services, including reduced emissions for deforestation and degradation (REDD+). By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and 'less-developed' countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities. Counter-hegemonic discourses to growth-centered green economy under the headings of buen vivir, mainly in the global South, and degrowth, mainly in the global North, therefore merit attention.","[McAfee, Kathleen] San Francisco State Univ, Int Relat, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"McAfee, K (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Int Relat, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",kmcafee@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,,56,57,7,137,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Leverage point frameworks that could facilitate such transformative system change have been created and are in use, but major issues remain. Scholars use the leverage point term in multiple contradicting ways, often confusing it with system outcomes or specific interventions. Accordingly, the underlying structural causes of unsustainability have received insufficient consideration in the proposed actions for transformational change. In this work, I address these issues by clarifying the definition for leverage points and by integrating them into a new blueprint for transformational change, with clarified structure and clearly defined transformational change terminology. I then theoretically demonstrate how the nine phases of the blueprint could be applied to both plan and implement transformational change in a socio-ecological system. Although the blueprint is designed to be applied for socio-ecological systems at national and international scales, it could also be applied to plan and implement transformational change in various sub-systems.","[Koskimaki, Teemu] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Koskimaki, T (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",teemu.koskimaki@anu.edu.au,,,Kone Foundation [201804577],Kone Foundation,"This research was funded by Kone Foundation, grant number 201804577.",,,2,2,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,9474,10.3390/su13169474,0,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH7QG,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000690119800001,0,en

The silicon content in this film is lower than in the compound to be synthesized. The film becomes continuous when its thickness exceeds 1.2 nm. It is shown that post-growth annealing at 240 degrees C can raise the silicon content in the film and be conducive to obtaining Heusler alloy of a desired composition.

The green economy may have the capacity to help animate a transition away from current socially and ecologically unsustainable patterns of economic growth only if notions of green growth can be discursively separated from green economy, strong articulations of green economy become dominant, and alternative measures of progress to gross domestic product are widely adopted. The concept of 'rearticulation', found in post-structural discourse theory, is proposed to guide this transition. This offers a framework to reconstruct notions of prosperity, progress, and security whilst avoiding direct and disempowering discursive conflict with currently hegemonic pro-growth discourses.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Ferguson, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",peterjf@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,,62,63,2,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

The crystal qualities of both the resultant In2O3 and the remaining InN were significantly improved by using CRTA instead of RTA. Body-center cubic (bcc) In2O3, consisting of two In2O3(111) variants in-plane rotated 60 degrees with respect to each other, was epitaxially grown on InN(0001).

Microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, together with the effect of Si3N4 encapsulations, provide evidence that the oxidation of InN is realized by oxygen inward diffusion. The oxygen inward diffusion is slowed down and the thermal decomposition of InN is suppressed by using CRTA, which in turn leads to a layer-by-layer oxidation of InN.","[Liu, H. F.; Chi, D.

By contrast, in the past two decades, notably in the 2000s, geography appears to have been forgetful of resources. In this paper it is argued that more attention needs to be paid to resource studies in human geography. It starts by comparing existing understandings and definitions of resources in respect of their usefulness as guiding concepts for research. This is followed by an overview of resource-related debates in various subdisciplines of geography. In (environmental) economic geography, the concept of global production networks has proved helpful for the discussion of problems connected with resources. An adaptation of this concept is presented here which can be used to analyse material and energy flows with the aid of social categories (e.g. such as power relations or governance) and to evaluate them in the light of normative categories (e.g. ecological sustainability or environmental justice).","[Schmitt, Thomas] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Schulz, Christian] Univ Luxembourg, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, Maison Sci Humaines, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Luxembourg,"Schmitt, T (corresponding author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",thomas.schmitt@fau.de; christian.schulz@uni.lu,,,,,,,,7,8,2,32,BOSS DRUCK MEDIEN GMBH,GOCH,"POSTFACH 10 01 54, GOCH, 47561, GERMANY",,,,ERDKUNDE,Erdkunde,OCT-DEC,2016,70,4,,,,,297,312,,10.3112/erdkunde.2016.04.01,0,,,16,"Geography; Geography, Physical",,Geography; Physical Geography,EH4JW,,Green Submitted,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000391738500001,0,en

We find that the completion of a global energy transition scenario compatible with the 1.5 degrees C objective of the Paris Agreement leads to a decrease of the system's EROI and to high investment share, employment and inflation trends, characteristic of a war economy. Our results further indicate that a slower growth rate eases the transition, and call for further work on post-growth scenarios studies.","[Jacques, Pierre; Jeanmart, Herve] Catholic Univ Louvain, IMMC Inst Mech Mat & Civil Engn, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Delannoy, Louis] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inria, LJK,STEEP, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Andrieu, Baptiste] Univ Grenoble Alpes, ISTerre, 1381 Rue Piscine, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Andrieu, Baptiste] Shift Project, 16-18 rue Budapest, F-75009 Paris, France; [Yilmaz, Devrim; Godin, Antoine] Agence Francaise Dev, 5 rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France; [Yilmaz, Devrim; Godin, Antoine] Univ Sorbonne Paris Nord, Ctr Rech Econ & gest Paris Nord, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Catholique Louvain; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Inria; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite de Savoie,"Jacques, P (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, IMMC Inst Mech Mat & Civil Engn, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",p.jacques@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Post-growth thermal vapor sulfurization of such Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O-TiO2 core-shell nanowires results in hybrid nanostructures of nanotubes decorated by nanoparticles. A combination of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that the nanotubes are anatase crystalline TiO2 while the nanoparticles decorated on the walls of the nanotubes are dominated by Co3S4 crystallites. The hybrid nanostructures have been electrochemically characterized in a 2 M KOH electrolyte, they exhibit a specific capacitance of 650 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1). However, the sulfurized TiO2 nanotubes, from which the nanowire cores were etched away in a dilute HCl (0.2 M) solution before the sulfurization, do not exhibit any apparent pseudocapacitance behaviors. They are more likely supporting templates in the hybrid nanostructures. These properties of the obtained hybrid nanostructures indicate that the cobalt sulfide nanoparticles decorated on TiO2 nanotubes fabricated by thermal vapor sulfurization can be promising electrodes for energy storage applications.","[Liu, H.

A shift to bio-based economy (bioeconomy) is an important component of this effort. This paper applies theoretical ideas from decolonial environmental justice and degrowth, placed in the wider context of transformations, to analyse the EU bioeconomy policy within the global context, and to draw lessons and recommendations for just transformations in the EU bioeconomy policy. I identify five dominant logics and approaches in the EU bioeconomy that act as barriers for just transformations and propose alternative ones that can support such transformations. Barriers and alternatives include (1) framing 'nature' as a resource and service provider for humans, who are seen as separate from nature, and the need to abandon human-nature duality; (2) dominance of economic green growth and technoscientific policy solutions, and the need to place planetary justice at the centre of tackling socioecological crises; (3) a limited approach to justice, and the need to act upon climate and epistemic justice, including self-determination and self-governing authority; (4) the EU's ambition for global leadership and competitiveness in global bioeconomic markets and governance, and the need to redefine global governance towards partnerships based on the principles of solidarity, mutual respect, reconciliation and redistribution of power and wealth; (5) hegemonic politico-economic structures and actor coalitions in charge of the EU bioeconomy, and the need for decentralized bottom-up leadership coalitions that promote direct democracy, local autonomy and sovereignty beyond state. I conclude with reflections on the politics of change and risks of co-optation, with a hope to inspire decolonial and just socioecological transformations in and beyond bioeconomy.","[Ramcilovic-Suominen, Sabaheta] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Itainen Pitkakatu 4 A, Turku 20520, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Ramcilovic-Suominen, S (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland, Itainen Pitkakatu 4 A, Turku 20520, Finland.",sabaheta.ramcilovik-suominen@luke.fi,,,Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Academy of Finland [332353]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [332353] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),Open access funding provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

Results on compositional distributions in ternary QDs and how they affect the QDs' electronic band gap are reported. A hierarchical modeling approach is followed that combines first-principles density functional theory calculations and classical Monte Carlo simulations with a continuum model of species transport in spherical nanocrystals. In certain cases, the model predicts the formation of core/shell-like structures with shell regions rich in the surface segregating species. A systematic parametric analysis generates a database of transport properties, which can be used to design post-growth thermal annealing processes that enable the development of thermodynamically stable QDs with optimal electronic properties grown through simple one-step colloidal synthesis techniques.

The required shift is comparable to the revolutionary change that must be made to the global economic system in order to achieve degrowth and is encapsulated in the definition of the term 'defashion'. The neologism is a call to action: to dismantle the current Fashion system and replace it with a pluriverse of clothing systems that are fair, local, decolonial and profoundly respectful and nurturing.

Through materials-selective post-growth oxidation it is also possible to combine amorphous oxides and crystalline, e.g. III-V materials. Such oxide-embedded structures pose a challenge for compositional characterization through transmission electron microscopy since the materials will overlap in projection. Furthermore, materials electrically isolated by an embedding oxide are more sensitive to electron beam-induced alterations. Methods that can directly isolate the embedded material, preferably at reduced electron doses, will be required in this situation. Here, we analyse the performance of two such techniques-local lattice parameter measurements from high resolution micrographs and bulk plasmon energy measurements from electron energy loss spectra-by applying them to analyse InP-AlInP segments embedded in amorphous aluminium oxide. We demonstrate the complementarity of the two methods, which show an overall excellent agreement. However, in regions with residual strain, which we analyse through molecular dynamics simulations, the two techniques diverge from the true value in opposite directions.","[Ek, Martin; Wahlqvist, David; Wallenberg, Reine] Lund Univ, Ctr Anal & Synth, Box 124, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Ek, Martin; Wallentin, Jesper; Wahlqvist, David; Ahadi, Aylin; Borgstrom, Magnus; Wallenberg, Reine] Lund Univ, NanoLund, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Petersson, C.

The high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of the ZnO: As films revealed that the As3d core level spectra is formed by three components located at about 41 eV, 44.5 eV and 45.5 eV below the Fermi level which we ascribe to AsO, As-Zn-2V(Zn) and As-Zn, respectively. The relative intensity of the three XPS contributions strongly depends on an annealing atmosphere, but in any case none of the contributions clearly dominates, which is a fingerprint of complicated nature of arsenic states in ZnO. This conclusion is also confirmed by the temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) studies.

The analysis approaches the Faroese Blue Economy from a holistic perspective using analytical concepts and frameworks of social (island) metabolism, environmental justice and degrowth to assess how current Blue Growth strategies pertain to long-term sustainability and human well-being. It offers a critical analysis of aquaculture in the Faroe Islands and shows that although the rhetoric around Blue Growth is framed within mainstreamed sustainability discourse, the ideologies and visions underpinning current Blue Growth strategies result in a continuation of conventional growth through the exploitation of new commodity frontiers. Finally, the negative consequences of Blue Growth are assessed and discussed through a mapping of recent and ongoing social and ecological distribution conflicts in the Faroes.","[Bogadottir, Ragnheiour] Univ Faroe Isl, Dept Hist & Social Sci, Jonas Broncks Gota 25, Torshavn, Faroe Islands",,"Bogadottir, R (corresponding author), Univ Faroe Isl, Dept Hist & Social Sci, Jonas Broncks Gota 25, Torshavn, Faroe Islands.",RagnheidurB@setur.fo,,,,,,,,23,23,1,23,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Hence, we suggest to frame degrowth as the promotion of new vocabularies within a deliberative account of democracy. Specifically, we proceed in three steps: first, we briefly review some essential critiques of modernity and their stance towards liberal democracy. Second, we illustrate how some of the argumentative patterns within the degrowth literature may inadvertently endanger core values of liberal democracy.

Nonetheless, a review of international biodiversity and sustainability policies shows that the majority advocate economic growth. Since improvements in resource use efficiency have so far not allowed for absolute global reductions in resource use and pollution, we question the support for economic growth in these policies, where inadequate attention is paid to the question of how growth can be decoupled from biodiversity loss. Drawing on the literature about alternatives to economic growth, we explore this contradiction and suggest ways forward to halt global biodiversity decline. These include policy proposals to move beyond the growth paradigm while enhancing overall prosperity, which can be implemented by combining top-down and bottom-up governance across scales. Finally, we call the attention of researchers and policy makers to two immediate steps: acknowledge the conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation in future policies; and explore socioeconomic trajectories beyond economic growth in the next generation of biodiversity scenarios.","[Otero, Iago;

P. doped ZnO thin films, which were grown on c-plane sapphire substrates, are studied using the Hall-effect measurement, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and optical absorption spectroscopy. An increase in P doping concentration converts ZnO thin films from insulating to n-type semiconducting with large resistivity (similar to 10(2) Omega cm) at room temperature. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) reduces the resistivity by several orders of magnitude. The core levels of Zn3s and Zn2p(3/2), probed by XPS using C1s as reference, are shifted monotonically to larger energies with increasing P doping concentration. An analysis of the optical absorption spectra near the band edge of ZnO reveals an exciton absorption peak at 3.37 eV, which is independent of P doping. RTA also induces a large-energy shift for the XPS core levels; however, the optical absorption spectra show an apparent blue-shift upon annealing. The correlations between the electrical and optical properties are related to an existence of a near-surface electron accumulation layer as well as donors' activation by RTA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The amount of Mg incorporation/activation was varied by using several Mg/Ga flow ratios and post-growth annealing treatment. For lower Mg/Ga flow ratios, the annealed nanorods clearly display a donor-acceptor pair band emission peaking at 3.26-3.27 eV and up to 4 LO phonon replicas, which can be considered as a reliable indicator of effective p-type Mg doping in the nanorod shell. For higher Mg/Ga flow ratios, a substantial enhancement of the yellow luminescence emission as well as several emission subbands are observed, which suggests an increase of disorder and the presence of defects as a consequence of the excess Mg doping.","[Hortelano, V.; Martinez, O.; Jimenez, J.] Univ Valladolid, GdS Optronlab, Fis Mat Condensada, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Cusco, R.; Artus, L.] CSIC, ICTJA, Inst Jaume Almera, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Hortelano, V.] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, Newtonstr 15, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Universidad de Valladolid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Geociencias Barcelona (GEO3BCN); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Jimenez, J (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, GdS Optronlab, Fis Mat Condensada, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",jimenez@fmc.uva.es,,,Junta de Castilla y Leon [VA293U13]; Spanish MINECO [MAT2015-71035],Junta de Castilla y Leon(Junta de Castilla y Leon); Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government),This work was partially funded by Junta de Castilla y Leon (VA293U13) and Spanish MINECO under project MAT2015-71035.

While many remain in denial that system change is necessary, others who call for system change fail to articulate what that change would entail. It is critical that the climate movement identifies and promotes specific strategies for change. Identifying synergistic proposals associated with ecosocialism and degrowth, we describe a set of policies, programs, and strategies that have the potential to justly minimize warming and that could become key demands of climate movement organizations attempting to influence governments in the Global North. While there are stigmas associated with ecosocialism and degrowth, the described strategies can be promoted without using these terms. Articulating specific strategies for system change is necessary to challenge the powerful actors and interests that continue to maintain the status quo and our current climate trajectory.","[Stuart, Diana] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Program Sustainable Communities, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Petersen, Brian] No Arizona Univ, Program Sustainable Communities, Dept Geog Planning & Recreat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Gunderson, Ryan] Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Stuart, D (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Program Sustainable Communities, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",diana.stuart@nau.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,APR 3,2023,20,3,,,,,432,446,,10.1080/14747731.2022.2106040,0,,AUG 2022,15,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,D3WD4,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000848299000001,0,en

It shows that the CESCR assumes economic growth to generally improve the realisation of ESC rights because it increases States' financial capacity and leads to employment creation. However, while the Committee deems that growth models should be inclusive, the CESCR never adopts a critical perspective on the possibility or desirability to pursue economic growth indefinitely. Despite recent evidence on the contested possibility to decouple economic activity from resource use, the Committee's recent ecological turn remains embedded in the growth paradigm. This article argues that the Committee should advocate towards decreasing the dependence of ESC rights on growth, especially when a State has reached a certain level of affluence.","[Petel, Matthias] Univ Louvain UCLouvain, Ottignies, Belgium; [Vander Putten, Norman] Univ St Louis Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,"Petel, M (corresponding author), UCLouvain Clos des Chanterelles 14, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",matthias.petel@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,,2,2,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,NETH Q HUM RIGHTS,Neth.

Due to the complexity of the matter, proposed solutions often address the symptoms of the current socioeconomic configuration rather than its core. To conceptualise possible future energy systems, this Perspective focuses on the disconnect between science and technology and engineering studies. On the one hand, this disconnect leads to social science research that passively critiques rather than contributes to tackling societal issues in practice. On the other, it produces technical work limited by the incumbent conceptualisations of economic activity and organisational configurations around production without capturing the broader social and political dynamics. We thus propose a schema for bridging this divide that uses the commons as an umbrella concept. We apply this framework on the hardware aspect of a conceptual energy system, which builds on networked microgrids powered by open-source, lower cost, adaptable, socially responsible and sustainable technology. This Perspective is a call to engineers and social scientists alike to form genuine transdisciplinary collaborations for developing radical alternatives to the energy conundrum.","[Giotitsas, Chris; Kostakis, Vasilis] Tallinn Univ Technol TalTech, Ragnar Nurkse Dept Innovat & Governance, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Nardelli, Pedro H.

In this work, scattering centers were observed only in the middle and upper parts of the as-grown crystals, whereas no light scattering was found in bottom parts. Furthermore, scattering centers can be removed by annealing at temperatures near the melting point, while they can also be created in the originally scatter-free crystals after being annealed at relatively low temperatures. Based on the results of post-growth heat treatments, the presence of a solid solution region near the melting point of BMF is proposed, and scattering centers were attributed to the precipitation of second-phase particles during crystal growth. Combining this hypothesis and the temperature distribution in the growth chamber, we are able to explain the scattering center formation mechanism and their inhomogeneous distribution in the as-grown crystals.

This article examines the cooperative sphere to draw out how affect and relationships in cooperatives may radically alter the sense of working democratically. It draws on methods of social dreaming and free association to examine cooperative development in three cases at different developmental stages: in Hamilton, Bermuda; Preston, UK; and Mondragon, Basque Country. It examines evidence of the way relationships and affect may emerge in organisational systems that place a focus on participatory democracy as opposed to hierarchical structures. We draw from intensive work in these cases to consider the distinctive background and contextual features that may be present within cooperative development processes.

First, the stylised facts about the greenhouse effect and the status quo are shown with special attention to emerging economies as key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. Globally, brown growth is still predominant. Since the Global South has to reduce emissions as much as the Global North, the resource-rich countries in the South face the gravest challenges. Second, different scenarios of the global transition with different combinations of GDP growth and reduction rates of the emission-to-GDP ratio are shown. The result is that both variables are important, but the reduction of the emissions ratio is more important than growth. Zero growth per se is not necessarily effective in reaching the Paris goals. Third, low green growth in the North is advised (under certain conditions also zero growth), and moderate green growth in the South. Zero growth without capital accumulation in a closed economy would terminate capitalism in its common definition, in contrast to zero growth in an open economy. Third, proposals from ecological economics for zero growth and de -growth are diverse and involve significant shortcomings, especially regarding the macroeconomic analysis.","[Priewe, Jan] HTW Berlin Univ Appl Sci, Berlin, Germany",,"Priewe, J (corresponding author), HTW Berlin Univ Appl Sci, Berlin, Germany.",jan.priewe@posteo.de,,,,,,,,3,3,1,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",,,,EUR J ECON ECON POLI,Eur.

Key questions that the authors investigate include: how will the renewable energy transition reshape the global balance of power? How will political-economic interdependencies and geopolitical alignments shift? Will contemporary petro-states adapt or collapse? And what new patterns of peace and conflict may emerge in a decarbonized world order? The authors provide different perspectives on the likely speed of the energy transition and its geopolitical implications. However, they occlude deeper questions about the depth of the transformations needed to prevent climate catastrophe-particularly in the nature of capitalism and military power-and the potential for more radical perspectives on energy futures. In contrast, I will argue that we should advance a critical research agenda on the global energy transition that accounts for the possibility of more far-reaching transformations in the political-economic, military, and ideological bases of world politics and highlights diverse movements fighting for their realization. These possible transformations include (1) transitions to post-growth political economies; (2) a radical shrinkage of emissions-intensive military-industrial complexes; and (3) decolonizing ideologies of progress. If struggles for alternative energy futures beyond the hegemony of economic growth and Western-style modernization are at the forefront of radical politics today, then these struggles deserve greater attention from critical IR scholars.","[Albert, Michael J.] SOAS Univ London, Int Relat, London, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Albert, MJ (corresponding author), SOAS Univ London, Polit & Int Studies, 10 Thornhaugh St, London NW1 7SY, England.",mal58@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,,3,3,9,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,ALTERNATIVES,Alternatives,AUG,2021,46,3,,,,,89,98,,10.1177/03043754211040698,0,,AUG 2021,10,International Relations,,International Relations,UK7TL,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000688760800001,0,en

The measurements have been performed on the diamonds in as-received state and after treatment with electron irradiation and high temperature (LPHT) annealing. It is found that single nitrogen defects in CVD diamond possess very high temperature stability, the positively charged single nitrogen atoms being exceptionally stable. In the as-received state, the diamonds show the signs of nitrogen aggregation, which are the result of the post-growth HPHT treatment. The treatment with electron irradiation and LPHT annealing has caused further aggregation of neutral nitrogen atoms and suppression (up to complete removal) of brown color. Many optical centers with narrow zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), not reported for natural diamonds, have been found all over the visible and near IR spectral ranges.

Nitrogen-doping is realized by in situ post-growth doping of monolayer graphene on SiC(0001) using a tunable hybrid plasma source, which exposes the graphene to a stream of ions and/or to a neutral flow of thermalized species from a precursor nitrogen gas. Using angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (ARIPES), we determine the doping level of the graphene through the analysis of the re states dispersion. At a dose of about 1 x 10(15) ions cm(-2) and an energy of similar to 35 eV, the Fermi level of the nitrogen-doped graphene is brought 0.4 eV above its value for the pristine graphene monolayer on SiC(0001). This n-type doping is attributed to a 8.7 at.% graphitic-nitrogen as revealed by the core level spectroscopy (XPS). In contrast, exposure to a beam of thermalized nitrogen atoms mainly induces pyridinic-like nitrogen doping of graphene. It is thus possible to control the predominant bonding configuration of the doping nitrogen by choosing either a thermalized atom or a low-energy ion source. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

[1] It resulted in the collapse of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments and downturns in stock markets around the world. It contributed to the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars, and a significant decline in economic activity, leading to a severe global economic recession in 2008.[2] In January of 2009, the IMF forecasted that advanced economies would not exit the recession until the middle of 2010. However, these economies posted growth of about two percent in the third quarter of 2009, and growth in emerging economies accelerated to eight percent in the second and third quarters-two percent higher than forecast. Additionally, global trade and industrial production are on a sharp recovery path. Although there have been aftershocks, the financial crisis itself ended sometime between late-2008 and mid-2009.[2] [3] HI Not all parts of world economy will however be recovering at the same rate and sharing a similar trend. Transportation industry is one of the critical issue which could affect the come-back of the very fast growing international trade and to a healthy and at a large-scale extended world economy. The shape of the recovery trend is affected critically by the strategical framework conceived as to overpass the market conditions that led to or were emerged as a consequence of the economic crisis. Moreover, especially in the case of international transport, the path towards liberalization or, to the contrary, protectionism of each transitory countries on the route of commercial and transportation chains will be giving the rhythm and quantity of increase of this sector. The complexity of transportation sector resides not only in the relations with the other sectors of the world economy but it stays within the sector itself from the different dynamics of the most important transport modes: by sea, on road, on rail and by air.","Alpha Bank, Constanta Branch, Eden Agcy, Constanta, Romania",,"Jercea, A (corresponding author), Alpha Bank, Constanta Branch, Eden Agcy, Constanta, Romania.",ajercea@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,0,0,0,7,EDITURA STIINTIFICA FMR,BUCHAREST,"CALEA GRIVITEI, NR 83, SECTOR 1, O P 12, BUCHAREST, 010705, ROMANIA",,,,METAL INT,Metal.

However, although omnipresent in the degrowth literature, the terms social imaginary and social imaginary significations have not been adequately explained. This creates a level of mystification that limits the analytical value of the degrowth framework. In addition, there is very little theoretical work on how actual social imaginaries can be decolonized and transformed. This paper first tries to clarify those concepts. Subsequently, it develops a theoretical framework for explaining such transitions of the imaginary. In developing this framework, the paper focuses on moments of crisis, since crises have been historically associated with change and transition. It argues that crises are important because they destabilize social imaginaries and open up a stage of suspension-a liminal stage-in which the rise of new social practices can facilitate the emergence of new social imaginary significations and institutions that can contribute to the alteration of the social imaginary at large. The paper draws on case studies related to the Greek crisis, the biggest ever faced by a country of the Global North after the Second World War.","[Varvarousis, Angelos] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Varvarousis, A (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",aggelosvar@gmail.com,,,Spanish Government through the project COSMOS [CSO2017-88212-R],Spanish Government through the project COSMOS,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper was supported economically by the Spanish Government through the project COSMOS CSO2017-88212-R.",,,5,5,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

NC integration relies on a combination of green and red NCs into a blend, which rises post-growth formulation issues. A careful engineering of the NCs may enable dual emissions from a single NC population which violates Kasha's rule, which stipulates that emission should occur at the band edge. Thus, in addition to an attentive control of band alignment to obtain green and red signals, non-radiative decay paths also have to be carefully slowed down to enable emission away from the ground state. Here, we demonstrate that core/crown/crown 2D nanoplatelets (NPLs), made of CdSe/CdTe/CdSe, can combine a large volume and a type-II band alignment enabling simultaneously red and narrow green emissions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ratio of the two emissions can be tuned by the incident power, which results in a saturation of the red emission due to non-radiative Auger recombination that affects this emission much stronger than the green one. Finally, we also show that dual-color, power tunable, emission can be obtained through an electrical excitation. Nanocrystals are desirable light sources for advanced display technologies. Here, the authors report on double-crowned 2D semiconductor nanoplatelets as light downconverters that offer both green and red emissions to achieve a wide color gamut.","[Dabard, Corentin; Po, Hong; Makke, Lina; Fu, Ningyuan; Xu, Xiang Zhen; Ithurria, Sandrine] Univ Paris 06, PSL Res Univ, Lab Phys & Etud Mat, ESPCI Paris,Sorbonne Univ,CNRS,UMR 8213, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Guilloux, Victor; Greboval, Charlie; Lhuillier, Emmanuel; Barisien, Thierry] Sorbonne Univ, Inst NanoSci Paris, INSP, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Silly, Mathieu G.] Synchrotron SOLEIL, Dept 128, F-91190 St Aubin, France; [Patriarche, Gilles] Univ Paris Saclay, C2N, CNRS, F-2110 Palaiseau, France; [Climente, Juan, I] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Quim Fis & Analit, E-12080 Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Diroll, Benjamin T.] Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanoscale Mat, Lemont, IL 60439 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; SOLEIL Synchrotron; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Universitat Jaume I; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Ithurria, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, PSL Res Univ, Lab Phys & Etud Mat, ESPCI Paris,Sorbonne Univ,CNRS,UMR 8213, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",sandrine.ithurria@espci.fr,,,"ERC starting grant blackQD [756225]; Ne2Dem [853049]; Region Ile-de-France in the framework of DIM Nano-K (grant dopQD); French state funds [ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02]; IPER-Nano2 [ANR-18-CE30-0023-01, ANR-19-CE24-0022, ANR-19-CE09-0017, ANR-19-CE09-0026, ANR-20-ASTR-0008-01, ANR-21-CE24-0012-02, ANR-21-CE09-0029, ANR-22-CE09]; MICINN [PID2021-128659NB-I00]; U.S. DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357];  [UJI-B2021-06]","ERC starting grant blackQD(European Research Council (ERC)); Ne2Dem; Region Ile-de-France in the framework of DIM Nano-K (grant dopQD); French state funds; IPER-Nano2; MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); U.S. DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE));","The project is supported by ERC starting grant blackQD (grant no. 756225, E.L.) and Ne2Dem (grant no. 853049, S.I.).

Central to many of these is a call for a degrowth approach. In this paper, a framework is developed to support a systematic analysis of degrowth in the academic literature. This article attempts to present a clearer notion of what the academic degrowth literature explores by identifying, organising, and analysing a set of proposals for action retrieved from a selection of articles. The framework is applied to classify proposals according to their alignment to ecological economics policy objectives (sustainable scale, fair distribution, and efficient allocation), type of approach (top-down versus bottom-up), and geographical focus (local, national, or international). A total of 128 peer-reviewed articles focused on degrowth were reviewed, and 54 that include proposals for action were analysed. The proposals identified align with three broad goals: (1) Reduce the environmental impact of human activities; (2) Redistribute income and wealth both within and between countries; and (3) Promote the transition from a materialistic to a convivial and participatory society. The findings indicate that the majority of degrowth proposals are national top-down approaches, focusing on government as a major driver of change, rather than local bottom-up approaches, as advocated by many degrowth proponents. The most emphasised aspects in the degrowth literature are related to social equity, closely followed by environmental sustainability. Topics such as population growth and the implications of degrowth for developing nations are largely neglected, and represent an important area for future research. Moreover, there is a need for a deeper analysis of how degrowth proposals would act in combination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the concept of sustainable degrowth is emerging aiming to introduce in our societies new social values and new policies, capable of satisfying human requirements whilst reducing environmental impacts and consumption of resources. In this framework, circular economy strategies for food production and food loss and waste management systems, following the Sustainable Development Goals agenda, are being developed based on a search for circularity, but without setting limits to the continual increase in environmental impacts and resource use. This work presents a methodology for determining the percentage of degrowth needed in any food supply chain, by analyzing four scenarios in a life cycle assessment approach over time between 2020 and 2040. Results for the Spanish case study suggested a degrowth need of 26.8% in 2015 and 58.9% in 2040 in order to achieve compliance with the Paris Agreement targets, highlighting the reduction of meat and fish and seafood consumption as the most useful path.","[Hoehn, Daniel; Laso, Jara; Margallo, Maria; Ruiz-Salmon, Israel; Aldaco, Ruben] Univ Cantabria, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Avda De los Castros S-N, Santander 39005, Spain; [Amo-Setien, Francisco Jose; Abajas-Bustillo, Rebeca; Sarabia, Carmen] Univ Cantabria, Dept Nursing, Avda Valdecilla S-N, Santander 39008, Spain; [Quinones, Ainoa] Univ Cantabria, Dept Business Adm, Avda De los Castros S-N, Santander 39005, Spain; [Vazquez-Rowe, Ian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Peruvian LCA Network PELCAN, Dept Engn, Av Univ 1801, Lima 15088, Peru; [Bala, Alba; Batlle-Bayer, Laura; Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere] UNESCO Chair Life Cycle & Climate Change ESCI UPF, Pg Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla (HUMV); Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Cantabria; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Aldaco, R (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Avda De los Castros S-N, Santander 39005, Spain.",daniel.hoehn@unican.es; jara.laso@unican.es; maria.margallo@unican.es; israel.ruizsalmon@unican.es; franciscojose.amo@unican.es; rebeca.abajas@unican.es; carmen.sarabia@unican.es; ainoa.quinones@unican.es; ian.vazquez@pucp.pe; alba.bala@esci.upf.edu; laura.batlle@esci.upf.edu; pere.fullana@esci.upf.edu; aldacor@unican.es,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Competitiveness [CTM2016-76176, PID2019-104925RB]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This research was funded by Spanish Ministry of Science and Competitiveness, grant number CERES-PROCON Project CTM2016-76176 (AEI/FEDER, UE) and KAIROS-BIOCIR Project PID2019-104925RB (AEO/FEDER, UE).",,,9,9,14,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,13,6,,,,,,,3379,10.3390/su13063379,0,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RV3CQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000645715700001,0,en

Due to the increase of commercial noni fruit products in the global market, an extensive phytochemical comparison of noni fruits and their juice products seems imperative to understand their internal quality. To this end, we developed an HPLC method, established phytochemical fingerprints, and quantitatively compared the characteristic components in 7 noni fruits and 13 commercial fruit juices originating from the Caribbean, Central America, the Central and South Pacific, and Asia. The results showed that scopoletin, rutin, quercetin, and 5,15-dimethylmorindol were detected in all the samples, although at varying concentrations. Together, these components could be used as a reference for identification and authentication of raw noni fruits and their commercial products. Meanwhile, the variation in phytochemical content in noni fruits and juices may be attributed to the diversity of geographical environments (soil, sunlight, temperature, precipitation, etc.) and post-growth factors (harvesting, storage, transportation, manufacturing processes, formulation, etc.). Further, the variation may also suggest different toxicological and pharmacological profiles. As such, scientific data of efficacy and safety conducted on one noni fruit or juice may not be applicable to all others, including those from the same origins. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that metastable MDs also form between layers nominally below critical thickness with respect to each other when externally driven threading dislocations (TDs) have significant dissimilarities in dislocation mobility in these layers controlled by glide kinetics. The InAs quantum dot laser on silicon presents a technologically important case for this phenomenon where TDs are pinned by indium-containing regions but glide in GaAs or AlGaAs cladding regions driven by thermal expansion mismatch strain with silicon during sample cool down following growth. This generates long MDs adjacent to the active region that is responsible for gradual degradation in performance. We calculate the driving force for MD formation and its dynamics in model structures, building up to full lasers, and describe the design of intentionally introduced indium-containing trapping layers that displace the MDs away from the active region, which is key to long laser lifetime. We show that factors controlling dislocation glide kinetics: doping, indium alloying, and dislocation core character have a strong influence on the final structure of defects. Yet, the introduction of indium must be done with care, illustrated using two cases where indium is not useful to overall device defect engineering.","[Mukherjee, Kunal] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Selvidge, Jennifer; Hughes, Eamonn; Shang, Chen; Bowers, John] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Norman, Justin] Quintessent Inc, Santa Barbara, CA 93102 USA; [Herrick, Robert] Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Intel Corporation,"Mukherjee, K (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94304 USA.",kunalm@stanford.edu,,,"Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) MTO LUMOS program [HR001120C0142]; U.S. Department of Defense under the AIM Photonics Manufacturing Innovation Institute, Air Force Contract [FA865015-2-5220]","Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) MTO LUMOS program(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); U.S. Department of Defense under the AIM Photonics Manufacturing Innovation Institute, Air Force Contract","The research reported here was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) MTO LUMOS program under Contract No. HR001120C0142 and the U.S. Department of Defense under the AIM Photonics Manufacturing Innovation Institute, Air Force Contract FA865015-2-5220.

The high responsivity of the NWs has been attributed to in situ post-growth annealing of GaAsSb axial NWs in the ultra-high vacuum. The enabling growth technology is molecular beam epitaxy for the Ga-assisted epitaxial growth of these NWs on Si (111) substrates. Room temperature Raman spectra, as well as temperature dependent micro-photoluminescence peak analysis indicated suppression of band tail states and non-radiative channels due to annealing. A similar improvement in in situ annealed p-i GaAsSb NW ensemble with an AlGaAs passivating shell was inferred from a reduction in the Schottky barrier height as well as the NW resistance compared to the as-grown NW ensemble. These results demonstrate in situ annealing of nanowires to be an effective pathway for improving the optoelectronic properties of the NWs and the device thereof.","[Sharma, Manish; Ahmad, Estiak; Dev, Durjoy; Li, Jia; Iyer, Shanthi] North Carolina A&T State Univ, Joint Sch Nanosci & Nanoengn, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA; [Li, Jia; Iyer, Shanthi] North Carolina A&T State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Reynolds, C.

It outlines a culturally sensitive response to a (conceived) paradox where humans embedded in nature experience alienation and estrangement from it. The article finds that if nature has a core, then the experienced distance makes sense. To describe the core of nature, three temporal lenses are employed: the core of nature as 'the past', 'the future', and 'the present'. It is proposed that while the degrowth movement should be inclusive of temporal perspectives, the lens of the present should be emphasised to balance out the prevailing romanticism and futurism in the theory and practice of degrowth.","[Heikkurinen, Pasi] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Latokartanonkaari 5, Helsinki 00500, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Heikkurinen, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Latokartanonkaari 5, Helsinki 00500, Finland.",pasi.heikkurinen@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,,4,4,4,16,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Central wafers from 1-3 cm diameter garnet grains within a 1.21 x 10(4) cm(3) block of pelitic schist were used to document concentric growth zoning of major elements, with decreasing Mn and Ca and increasing Fe and Mg from cores to rims. Garnets also preserve growth zoning patterns for HREE and MREE and show evidence for resorption and partial recrystallization of the outermost rims. Similar garnet core compositions and identical garnet rim compositions for large like sized porphyroblasts throughout the sample suggest that garnet growth occurred at near equilibrium P-T-X conditions for major elements over the sample volume. Comparison of 28 rock Sm-Nd isotope values from the sample indicates substantial cm-scale heterogeneity, which precludes meaningful use of local garnet rock isotope pairs for isochron age calculation. Therefore, Sm-Nd isotopic compositions of thirty-eight concentric core to rim garnet segments from ten large (1-3 cm) garnets and two small (1-4 mm) bulk garnets, with narrow ranges of Mn content, are paired with sixteen matrix/whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic compositions collected over the rock volume to define a range of isochron ages from 383.1 +/- 6.8 Ma to 324.5 +/- 3.3 Ma. Four of the garnets have anomalously young rims that likely result from post-growth alteration. Chlorite, quartz, and xenotime haloes around garnet suggest that anomalously young garnet rim ages reflect post-growth resorption/recrystallization effects. Excluding these young rims yields a range of ages from 383.1 +/- 6.8 (oldest core) to 374.9 +/- 1.8 Ma (youngest rim). Sm-Nd age precisions > 1.5 m.y. (and high MSWD) result primarily from isotopic heterogeneity in the finely layered metasedimentary rock matrix. However, garnet cores with high Mn (n = 7), mantles with intermediate Mn (n = 14), and rims with low Mn (n = 8; including the 2 smaller bulk garnet analyses), define three distinct multi-grain isochrons of 380.3 +/- 2.0 Ma (n = 23, MSWD = 14), 377.3 +/- 1.4 Ma (n = 30, MSWD = 18), and 376.5 +/- 1.0 Ma (n = 24, MSWD= 18), respectively, yielding an average garnet growth duration of 3.8 +/- 2.2 m.y. These three composite Mn-age zones define a Mn vs. age relationship that reflects depletion of Mn in the rock matrix as it is sequestered by growing garnet. Correlation of garnet major element compositions throughout the sample suggests that major element matrix equilibrium was generally maintained (to a first order) throughout the ca. 4 m.y. duration of garnet growth.

To this end, the connection between the current subject order, the present social crises and the complex entanglement of the prevailing mode of production and life is explained. A socio-ecological transformation would therefore also have to be linked to the emergence of an alternative subject culture which is oriented towards cooperation and community. The Association of Common Good Economy (Verein der Gemeinwohl-Oekonomie) and common good-oriented companies are used in this research as a space to observe social-cultural practices and new forms and conventions of cooperation in their acceptance and dissemination. On the one hand, it shows that these companies, with their values based on cooperation, social and global justice and ecological responsibility, and with their participatory organizational structures, offer opportunities for countercultural practices and make utopias tangible, so that social change and self-change are being made possible on a small scale. On the other hand, by means of detailed examples the inconsistencies of social-cultural practices and the hybrid mixture of subject forms become clear and comprehensible in their specific context.","[Kuehn, Cornelia] Humboldt Univ, Inst Europaische Ethnol, Mohrens 41, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Kuhn, C (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Europaische Ethnol, Mohrens 41, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,,1,1,2,3,WAXMANN VERLAG GMBH,MUNSTER,"STEINFURTER STRASSE 555, MUNSTER, GERMANY",,,,Z VOLKSKUNDE,Z.

Postcolonial scholars critiqued the discourses that were perpetuating its failures. Latin American decolonial scholars sharpened the analysis, rejecting Eurocentric frames of thought and drawing on a plurality of voices and ways of knowing. Mounting evidence of global socio-ecological interdependence has led to the emergence of discourses of transition advocating a break with the civilizational model of the modern West. Buen vivir and postextractivism are two Latin American examples of these discourses.

The study has been carried out in combination with ex situ contactless charge injection, complemented with various post-growth irradiation treatments, with the intent to assess the presence and atomic nature of occurring charge trapping centers. In HfO2 layers grown by atomic layer (AL) and metal-organic (MO) CVD, this reveals the reproducible appearance of a paramagnetic center, termed H5, in firm correlation with alternate positive/negative charge injection, i.e., distinct signal intensity increase/decrease, respectively. Simulation of the observed powder pattern for both K- and Q-band consistently points to a defect of orthorhombic symmetry characterized by g(1) = 1.880 +/- 0.006, g(2) = 1.900 +/- 0.006, g(3) = 1.981 +/- 0.0015. Analysis based on the inferred spectroscopic ESR characteristics in comparison with previous theoretical work leads to the suggestion that the observed center may concern an O-vacancy defect, closest perhaps to the 4-fold 1 + charged O-vacancy (V-O4(+)). The revealed defect may account, at least partly, for the previously reported distinct propensity of positive charge trapping in Si/hafnia structures grown by ALCVD and MOCVD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on two EU policy communications aimed at the challenge: stepping up EU action to protect and restore the world's forests and the EU updated bioeconomy strategy. In addition, we refer to the European Green Deal, which articulates the bloc's overarching vision for sustainability and transformations. We find that by casting deforestation as a production problem and a governance challenge on the supply side, these policies deflect attention from some of the key drivers of tropical deforestation-the EU's overconsumption of deforestation-related commodities and asymmetric market and trade power relations. The diversion allows the EU unfettered access to agro-commodities and biofuels, which are important inputs to the EU's green transition and bio-based economy. Upholding a 'sustainability image' within the EU, an overly business-as-usual approach has taken precedence over transformative policies, enabling multinational corporations to run an ecocide treadmill, rapidly obliterating tropical forests. Whereas the EU's plan to nurture a bioeconomy and promote responsible agro-commodities production in the global South are relevant, the bloc is evasive in setting firm targets and policy measures to overcome the inequalities that spring from and enable its overconsumption of deforestation-related commodities. Drawing on degrowth and decolonial theories, we problematise the EU's anti-deforestation policies and highlight alternative ideas that could lead to more just, equitable and effective measures for confronting the tropical deforestation conundrum.","[Kumeh, Eric Mensah; Ramcilovic-Suominen, Sabaheta] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Bioecon & Environm Unit, Itainen Pitkakatu 4A, Turku 20520, Finland; [Kumeh, Eric Mensah] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Leverhulme Ctr Nat Recovery, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Oxford,"Kumeh, EM (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland, Bioecon & Environm Unit, Itainen Pitkakatu 4A, Turku 20520, Finland.;Kumeh, EM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Leverhulme Ctr Nat Recovery, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.",ekumehmensah@gmail.com,,,Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Academy of Finland,Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"Open access funding provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

The core features of this program are massive global investments in energy efficiency and clean renewable energy so that clean energy supplants the existing fossil-fuel-dominant global energy system. Through annual investments in the range of 2 percent of global GDP in clean energy and a corresponding contraction in fossil fuel consumption, the global economy can maintain an absolute decoupling trajectory-i.e., economic growth proceeds while CO2 emissions fall to zero within 30-40 years.

The structures are designed by simply playing with the growth conditions and without any use of template or additive in the aqueous deposition bath. Two types of hierarchical structures are described combining electrodeposited ZnO nanowire arrays and a nanoporous layer: nanowire arrays covered by a conformal nanoporous layer and nanowire arrays embedded in a nanoporous layer. The global performances of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated using the hierarchical structures are higher than those found for nanoparticulate sol-gel ZnO films and for the two basic electrodeposited structures. Films made of nanowires embedded in a nanocrystalline matrix show a maximum energy conversion efficiency of similar to 4.1%. The wires play several important beneficial roles in the presented structures since they permit the electrodeposition of thick nanoporous ZnO films which immobilize a large amount of dye, they act as preferential electron pathways for efficient charge collection and, due to their size, they enhance the light trapping in the photoanode and hence increase the light diffusion length before its harvesting by the dye. Another interest of the proposed ZnO hierarchical structures is a synthesis as well as an applied post-growth thermal treatment performed below 150 degrees C in soft environments which are then perfectly compatible with lightweight plastic flexible and other fragile substrates.","[Guerin, Victoire-Marie; Pauporte, Thierry] ENSCP, CNRS, UMR7575, LECIME, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Chimie ParisTech,"Guerin, VM (corresponding author), ENSCP, CNRS, UMR7575, LECIME, 11 Rue P & M Curie, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Thierry-pauporte@chimie-paristech.fr,,,French National Agency of Research (ANR) [ANR-08-HABISOL-002]; CNRS [nanoZnO-solar PR08-2.1-10],French National Agency of Research (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)),"Dr H.

A number of studies examined selected relationships, but the general implications for future development options to achieve environmentally and socially sustainable development of countries at different levels of per capita resource footprints, quality of life, and income have not yet been investigated in detail. In this study, we use a global dataset with 173 countries to assess the overall relationship between resource footprints, quality of life, and economic development over the period of 1990-2015. We select the material footprint and carbon footprint and contrast them with the Human Development Index, the Happiness Index, and GDP per capita. Regression analyses show that the relationship between various resource footprints and quality of life generally follows a logarithmic path of development, while resource footprints and GDP per capita are linearly connected. From the empirical results, we derive a generalized path of development and cluster countries along this path. Within this comprehensive framework, we discuss options to change the path to respect planetary and social boundaries through a combination of resource efficiency increases, substitution of industries and sufficiency of consumption.

The growth of the industrial fleet led to an initial increase in global catches from the 1950s to the 1990s; yet, today, several marine fish stocks are harvested at unsustainable rates, and catches are stagnating. As a result, industrial fishers increase investments and fishing effort, reaching farther and deeper, while small-scale fishers face the threat of disappearance as both their catches and livelihoods worsen. The emergent international emphasis on Blue Growth is likely to put further pressure on marine capture fisheries. This paper explores how the growth imperative in the seas has manifested itself in Turkey since the 1970s and how industrial and small-scale fishers responded to this growth spiral in the seas. Based on participant observation methods and in-depth interviews, this paper problematizes the expanding boundaries of industrial fishers and examines the reactions of small-scale fishing cooperatives in Istanbul, in particular their proposed alternative economic model, as a response to the growth imperative. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the crisis that small-scale fishers are facing not only presents economic and ecological difficulties, but also represents an existential threat to the identity and traditional ways of life as a fisher. The strategies adopted by small-scale fishers in response to this crisis in Turkey, especially in Istanbul, are politicizing fishers as they open up new spaces, collaborations, and demands for environmental, social, and economic justice. However, their efforts constitute an ongoing process prone to numerous tensions and contradictions. This paper concludes that challenging the growth paradigm in fisheries via the Blue Degrowth framework can be useful for analyzing emerging alternative imaginaries to the growth-driven capitalist economic system among small-scale fishers.","[Ertor-Akyazi, Pinar] Bogazici Univ, Inst Environm Sci, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Ertor-Akyazi, P (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Inst Environm Sci, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",pinar.ertor@boun.edu.tr,,,,,,,,11,11,2,6,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This can be achieved by retrieving the chemical profile of core/shell NCs using anomalous small angle x-ray scattering (ASAXS) in combination with the analysis of powder diffraction data recorded by wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS). In the current synchrotron based study, we investigate CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs with different core dimensions by recording simultaneously ASAXS and WAXS spectra. The CdS shells are grown epitaxial on nominal spherical CdSe cores with core diameters from around 3.5-5.5 nm. Three different CdSe shell thicknesses are realized by depositing around 4, 6, and 8 monolayers (MLs) of CdSe. We reveal that the epitaxial core/shell structure depicts a chemical sharp interface, even after a post growth annealing step. With increasing NC diameter, however, the CdSe/CdS NCs deviate significantly from a spherical shape. Instead an elliptical particle shape with pronounced surface facets for the larger core/shell NCs is found. In combination with the powder diffraction data we could relate this anisotropic shape to a mixture of crystal phases within the CdSe core. The smallest CdSe cores exhibit a pure hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure, whereas the larger ones also possess a cubic zincblende phase fraction. This mixed crystal phase fractions lead to a non-spherical shell growth with different thicknesses along specific crystallographic directions: The long axes are terminated by basal crystal faces parallel either to the a- or c-axis, the short axes by tilted pyramidal planes. By combining these structural data with the measured PL quantum yield values, we can clearly connect the optical output of the NCs to their shape and to their shell thickness.

These were used to obtain Sn:In2O3/NiS2 core-shell nanowires by the deposition of 10 nm Ni over the Sn:In2O3 nanowires followed by post growth processing under H2S between 100 and 200 degrees C. The Sn:In2O3/NiS2 nanowires have diameters of approximate to 100 nm and lengths up to approximate to 100 /mu m and consist of cubic bixbyite Sn:In2O3 surrounded by 3 nm NiS2 crystalline quantum dots with a cubic crystal structure. Higher temperatures of 300-500 degrees C result in the formation of NiS2 quantum dots and cubic In3S4 branches around the Sn:In2O3. We find that the p-type NiS2 in contact with n-type Sn:In2O3 NWs gives rectifying current-voltage (IV) characteristics due to the formation of a p-n heterojunction with a straddling type band alignment where electrons are confined to the n-type Sn:In2O3 core and holes in the p-type NiS2, as shown by self-consistent Poisson-Schrodinger calculations in the effective mass approximation. The gas evolution of O-2 and H2 was measured using the Sn:In2O3/NiS2 nanowires as the anode and Pt as the cathode in a two-compartment photoelectrochemical cell containing 1 M KOH (aq) and 0.5 M H2SO4 (aq), respectively, under light of 1 sun. We obtain 7.8 mu L/min of O-2 and 15.0 mu L/min of H-2 at an overpotential of 0.2 V and 25 degrees C from the Sn:In2O3/NiS2 nanowires on C.

Three fundamental premises underly an investigation of these issues. Firstly, territorial management underpins global environmental justice through the implementation of conservation policies; Secondly, degrowth narratives must operate in the urban context; and thirdly, there is a need for a paradigm shift at an economic, social and nature-relational level. This article presents two research approaches. Firstly, it sets out a theoretical framework in the field of 'urban degrowth', collecting arguments from political ecology, urban planning, deep ecology and degrowth thinking; and secondly, it proposes a preliminary line of investigation towards the process of urban de-occupation and re-naturalization through a bibliographic analysis of urban-ecological variables fostering natural recovery. The aim of the study is to stir up discussion about urban degrowth, as an essential mechanism to counter increasing land consumption, and global habitat and biodiversity loss.

It also explores degrowth's relevance to developing countries that have lower levels of material living standards compared to the European countries where it originated. The main argument of this article is that degrowth has significant potential to advance progressive socioecological transformation. Its advocates have also implemented some interesting alternative economic practices, such as nonmonetary exchanges and recreations of the commons, which prioritize socioecological sustainability over profit maximization. However, the degrowth movement has so far paid little attention to the structural hierarchy of the global political economy and hence has not made sufficient suggestions about how to address uneven development within and between countries, which will likely hinder progressive and ecologically sustainable transitions across the globe. Unfair global trade practices and concentrated control over advanced technologies are contentious points that might prevent widespread support for degrowth ideas in developing countries. Some developing countries and subnational local groups also face more constraints than others if they want to scale-up noncapitalist initiatives that are compatible with the degrowth vision, not to mention that some might lack financial means to drive transformative change. These issues cut across the spheres of production, consumption, trade, and finance, which suggests that structural reforms of the global political economy are called for to address unequal relations between developed and developing countries and also inequality within countries.","[Chiengkul, Prapimphan] Thammasat Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Chiengkul, P (corresponding author), Thammasat Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",phan14@tu.ac.th,,,Thammasat University [1/1/2559],Thammasat University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Thammasat University Research Fund under TU Research Scholar grant number 1/1/2559.",,,9,9,6,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,ALTERNATIVES,Alternatives,MAY,2018,43,2,,,,,81,95,,10.1177/0304375418811763,0,,,15,International Relations,,International Relations,HJ0WM,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000456883900002,0,en

Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that many 'environmental' problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different 'senses of justice' and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food-water-health nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the 'elephant in the room'-the failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind.","[Menton, Mary; Peck, Mika] Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Larrea, Carlos] Simon Bolivar Andean Univ, Quito, Ecuador; [Latorre, Sara] Latin Amer Fac Social Sci, Quito, Ecuador; [Martinez-Alier, Joan; Walter, Mariana] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Temper, Leah] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Sussex; Autonomous University of Barcelona; McGill University,"Menton, M (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",mcsmenton@gmail.com,,,"Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex; ERC [GA 695446]","Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission)","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme, University of Sussex; and ERC Adv.

State, corporate and social actors have responded to economic decline by embracing a range of coping and adaptation strategies, some of which are consistent with degrowth, but they are often combined with business-as-usual initiatives in pursuit of economic growth. We refer to this as subordinate degrowth because localised responses are conditioned by the subordinate position of countries and cities in the global economy. While we acknowledge its divergence from 'pure' ideal-type degrowth, we do not dismiss the transformative potential of incremental change. Indeed, we argue that any realistic strategy to spatialise degrowth within cities must recognise the indeterminacy and messiness of urban politics. We employ subordinate degrowth as an analytic to interpret responses to deindustrialisation and economic decline in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our analysis attends to three meso-level blind spots that characterise much degrowth scholarship, between (1) particular and universal, (2) advanced-industrial and agrarian ideal-types and (3) past/current socio-technical regimes and 'pure' degrowth.","[Schindler, Seth; Kanai, J.

Based on recent research, we approach the necessary redistribution of energy consumption at the global level and the elements that should be present in energy descent strategies. We establish an approximate threshold of minimum and maximum per capita final energy consumption, between 15.6 GJ and 31.0 GJ for the year 2050, which serves as a reference for evaluating scenarios. We continue with an analysis of two ecological transition scenarios for Spain between 2020 and 2030, Green New Deal and Degrowth.

The application of traditional doping methods developed for bulk materials involves additional considerations for nanoscale semiconductors because of the influence of surfaces and stochastic fluctuations, which may become significant at the nanometer-scale level. Monolayer doping is an ex situ doping method that permits the post growth doping of nanowires. Herein, using atom-probe tomography (APT) with subnanometer spatial resolution and atomic-ppm detection limit, we study the distributions of boron and phosphorus in ex situ doped silicon nanowires with accurate control. A highly phosphorus doped outer region and a uniformly boron doped interior are observed, which are not predicted by criteria based on bulk silicon. These phenomena are explained by fast interfacial diffusion of phosphorus and enhanced bulk diffusion of boron, respectively. The APT results are compared with scanning tunneling spectroscopy data, which yields information concerning the electrically active dopants. Overall, comparing the information obtained by the two methods permits us to evaluate the diffusivities of each different dopant type at the nanowire oxide, interface, and core regions. The combined data sets permit us to evaluate the electrical activation and compensation of the dopants in different regions of the nanowires and understand the details that lead to the sharp p-i-n junctions formed across the nanowire for the ex situ doping process.","[Sun, Zhiyuan; Lauhon, Lincoln J.; Seidman, David N.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2220 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Hazut, Ori; Yerushalmi, Roie] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Hazut, Ori; Yerushalmi, Roie] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Nanosci & Nanotechnol, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Huang, Bo-Chao; Chiu, Ya-Ping; Chang, Chia-Seng] Acad Sinica, Inst Phys, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chiu, Ya-Ping] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Seidman, David N.] NUCAPT, 2220 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan Normal University,"Lauhon, LJ; Seidman, DN (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2220 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Yerushalmi, R (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.;Yerushalmi, R (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Nanosci & Nanotechnol, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.;Chiu, YP (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Phys, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;Chiu, YP (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Taipei 116, Taiwan.;Seidman, DN (corresponding author), NUCAPT, 2220 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,"United States Israel Binational Science Foundation [2012088]; Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Community [259312]; Academia Sinica; HUJI center for nanoscience and nanotechnology; MRI program of the National Science Foundation [DMR-0420532]; DURIP program of the Office of Naval Research [N00014-0400798, N00014-0610539, N00014-0910781]; National Science Foundation's MRSEC Program [DMR-1121262]; Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN); MRSEC program at the Materials Research Center [NSF DMR-1121262]; International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN); State of Illinois through the IIN; Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental (SHyNE) Resource [NSF NNCI-1542205];  [DMR-1308654]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Materials Research [1308654] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",United States Israel Binational Science Foundation(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)); Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); HUJI center for nanoscience and nanotechnology; MRI program of the National Science Foundation; DURIP program of the Office of Naval Research; National Science Foundation's MRSEC Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN); MRSEC program at the Materials Research Center; International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN); State of Illinois through the IIN; Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental (SHyNE) Resource; ; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Materials Research(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"D.N.S., L.J.L., R.Y., O.H., and Z.S. acknowledge funding support from the United States Israel Binational Science Foundation (grant number 2012088) and Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Rutile TiO2 nanostructures with morphologies such as nanorods, nanopillars and nanoflowers, depending upon the growth conditions, are synthesized by an acid-hydrothermal process. Depending on the growth conditions and post-growth annealing, lattice contraction and expansion are observed in the nanostructures and it is found to correlate with the nature and density of intrinsic defects in rutile TiO2. The change in lattice volume correlates well with the optical bandgap energy. Irrespective of growth conditions, the TiO2 nanostructures exhibit strong near infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) at 1.43 eV and a weak visible PL, which are attributed to the Ti interstitials and O vacancies, respectively, in rutile TiO2 nanostructures. Further, ESR study reveals the presence of singly ionized oxygen vacancy defects. It is observed that lattice distortion depends systematically on the relative concentration and type of defects such as oxygen vacancies and Ti interstitials. XPS analyses revealed a downshift in energy for both Ti 2p and O 1s core level spectra for various growth conditions, which is believed to arise from the lattice distortions. It is proposed that the Ti4+ interstitial and F+ oxygen vacancy defects are primarily responsible for lattice expansion, whereas the electrostatic attraction between Ti4+ interstitial and O2- interstitial defects causes the lattice contraction in the undoped TiO2 nanostructures. The control of lattice parameters through the intrinsic defects may provide new routes to achieving novel functionalities in advanced materials that can be tailored for future technological applications.","[Santara, Batakrushna; Giri, P.

This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a design global, manufacture local model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production.

But the incipient debate on democracy and degrowth suffers from general definitions and limited connections to political philosophy and democracy theory. This article offers a critical review of democracy theory within the degrowth literature, taking as its focal point a relevant debate between Serge Latouche and Takis Fotopoulos. We argue that the core of their contention can be traced back to the relationship between the concepts of democracy and autonomy as defined by philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis, which both authors and generally the degrowth movement consider as one of their theoretical reference points. We show how both Latouche and Fotopoulos hold a misconception of Castoriadis' notions of autonomy, the social imaginary and politics, which in turn limits their cognisance of democracy and hence confuses their debate concerning the possibilities for a degrowth transition within the confines of a liberal parliamentary democracy. With a clarified theoretical understanding of the interconnected democracy-autonomy assemble, we proceed to an evaluation of the revolutionary potential of the degrowth movement and to a better understanding of a possible relationship between democracy and degrowth.","[Asara, Viviana; Kallis, Giorgos] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, ETSE, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Profumi, Emanuele] Ehess Cespra, Paris, France; [Asara, Viviana] Carrer Princesa, Res & Degrowth, Barcelona 08003, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Asara, V (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, ETSE, QC-3091, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",viviana.asara@gmail.com,,,,,,,,55,55,4,53,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

Virtually everyone is now familiar with the term Sustainable Development, from states to multinational corporations, and from affluent communities in the Global North to impoverished communities in the Global South. It received a new lease of life in 2015 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is recognized that sustainable development requires an inter-disciplinary, multi-level, and bottom-up approach, and that this ideal is easy to state but difficult to operationalize. Pursuant to deliberations at an international workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which aimed at fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse experts and developing solutions for effective inclusion of women and youth in climate change response strategies, we propose an innovative, practical three-dimensional model that enhances sustainability theory and practice with cross-cutting integration of human rights, gender equity, and Indigenous and local knowledge. We evaluate the utility of the model in two ways: First, we analyze how the model informs current approaches to environmental sustainability and human wellbeing including the SDGs, agroecology, de-growth principles, and planetary health metrics. Then, we explore the feasibility and added value of the approach through seven case studies from Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Peru, Cote D'Ivoire, and Aotearoa-New Zealand. We conclude that the proposed model is congruent with current theory and practice. It builds on existing principles by identifying and addressing gaps. It enables practical action in a variety of settings and fosters a more integrated approach to sustainable wellbeing for humanity and our earth. We recommend continued development of this theoretical framework and related guidelines for program design, implementation and evaluation.","[DiPrete Brown, Lori] Univ Wisconsin, Global Hlth Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [DiPrete Brown, Lori; Atapattu, Sumudu; Stull, Valerie Jo; Calderon, Claudia Irene; Huambachano, Mariaelena] Univ Wisconsin, Initiat Women & Wellbeing Wisconsin & World 4W, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [DiPrete Brown, Lori; Huambachano, Mariaelena] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Human Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Atapattu, Sumudu] Univ Wisconsin, Law Sch, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Atapattu, Sumudu] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Human Rights Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Calderon, Claudia Irene] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Houenou, Marie Josee Paula] WESISAH, C40 City Adviser,BP 757, Abidjan 22, Cote Ivoire; [Snider, Anna] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Monzon, Andrea] MealFlour Director Programs, Quetzaltenango 09001, Guatemala",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Brown, LD (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Global Hlth Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Brown, LD; Atapattu, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Initiat Women & Wellbeing Wisconsin & World 4W, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Brown, LD (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Human Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Atapattu, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Law Sch, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Atapattu, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Human Rights Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dipretebrown@wisc.edu; sumudu.atapattu@wisc.edu; vstull@wisc.edu; cicalderon@wisc.edu; huambachano@wisc.edu; mariejoseehouenou@gmail.com; asnider@illinois.edu; andrea@mealflour.org,,,African Studies Program at UW-Madison,African Studies Program at UW-Madison,"The authors acknowledge the African Studies Program and the Global Health Institute at UW-Madison, for respectively providing the generous Young African Leaders Initiative-Mandela Washington Fellowship travel award to Marie Josee Paula Houenou and for hosting the International Gender and Climate Change Workshop in September 2019.

Economic degrowth for social equity and ecological sustainability. Introduction to this special issue,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crisis; Economic growth; Degrowth; Democracy; Green new deal; Ecological economics; Rebound effect; Voluntary simplicity; Well-being,,"This article reviews the burgeoning emerging literature on sustainable degrowth. This is defined as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances ecological conditions at the local and global level, in the short and long term. The paradigmatic propositions of degrowth are that economic growth is not sustainable and that human progress without economic growth is possible. Degrowth proponents come from diverse origins. Some are critics of market globalization, new technologies or the imposition of western models of development in the rest of the world. All criticize GDP accounting though they propose often different social and ecological indicators. Degrowth theorists and practitioners support an extension of human relations instead of market relations, demand a deepening of democracy, defend ecosystems, and propose a more equal distribution of wealth. We distinguish between depression, i.e. unplanned degrowth within a growth regime, and sustainable degrowth, a voluntary, smooth and equitable transition to a regime of lower production and consumption. The question we ask is how positive would degrowth be if instead of being imposed by an economic crisis, it would actually be a democratic collective decision, a project with the ambition of getting closer to ecological sustainability and socio-environmental justice worldwide. Most articles in this issue were originally presented at the April 2008 conference in Paris on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity. This conference brought the word degrowth and the concepts around it into an international academic setting. Articles of this special issue are summarized in this introductory article. Hueting, d'Alessandro and colleagues, van den Bergh, Kerschner, Spangenberg and Alcott discuss whether current growth patterns are (un)sustainable and offer different perspectives on what degrowth might mean, and whether and under what conditions it might be desirable. Matthey and Hamilton focus on social dynamics and the obstacles and opportunities for voluntary social action towards degrowth. Lietaert and Cattaneo with Gavalda offer a down-to-earth empirical discussion of two practical living experiments: cohousing and squats, highlighting the obstacles for scaling up such alternatives. Finally van Griethuysen explains why growth is an imperative in modern market economies, raising also the question whether degrowth is possible without radical institutional changes.

To achieve steep emission reductions, the world would have to either decouple global GHG emissions from gross domestic product (GDP) at an unprecedented pace or face deep cuts to GDP. The so-called 'green growth' literature is optimistic that suitable policies and technology can enable such fast decoupling, while 'degrowth' proponents dismiss this and argue that the global economy must be scaled down, and that systemic change and redistribution is necessary to accomplish this. We use the so-called Kaya identity to offer a simple quantitative assessment of the gap between the historic performance in reducing the emission intensity of GDP and what is required for green growth, i.e., the basis of ongoing disagreement. We then review the literature on both degrowth and green growth and discuss their most important arguments and proposals. Degrowth authors are right to point out the considerable gap between current climate mitigation efforts and what is needed, as well as the various technological uncertainties and risks such as rebound effects. However, the often radical degrowth proposals also suffer from many uncertainties and risks. Most importantly, it is very unlikely that alternative welfare conceptions can convince a critical mass of countries to go along with a degrowth agenda. Governments should therefore instead focus on mobilizing the necessary investments, pricing carbon emissions, and encouraging innovation and behavioral change.","[Lenaerts, Klaas; Tagliapietra, Simone; Wolff, Guntram B.] Bruegel Org, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium; [Tagliapietra, Simone] Catholic Univ, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Sacred Heart, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Wolff, Guntram B.] Free Univ Brussels, Solvay Business Sch, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Lenaerts, K; Tagliapietra, S; Wolff, GB (corresponding author), Bruegel Org, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.;Tagliapietra, S (corresponding author), Catholic Univ, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Sacred Heart, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Wolff, GB (corresponding author), Free Univ Brussels, Solvay Business Sch, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",klaas.lenaerts@bruegel.org; simone.tagliapietra@unicatt.it; guntram.wolff@bruegel.org,,,,,,,,1,1,7,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,14,9,,,,,,,5555,10.3390/su14095555,0,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1F8JY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000795409500001,0,en

These spectra allow the evolution of OH absorption characteristics with prolonged VTE to be followed. After 2 h of VIE process an additional absorption appears at 3483 cm(-1). A transition regime that the original 3536 cm(-1) and new 3483 cm(-1) absorptions simultaneously appear exists within the VIE duration range of 2-16 h. In this regime, the 3536 cm(-1) absorption becomes weak gradually and eventually disappears around 16 h while the 3483 cm(-1) absorption increases remarkably with the prolonged VIE. The presence of transition regime gives a hint that the 3483 cm(-1) absorption is due to the VIE-induced formation of a new center. Based upon the spectral features, we have suggested a simple three-layer (two on surface and one in the center of crystal plate) model to describe the depth profile of the photorefractive damage MgO concentration threshold in the crystal in the transition regime. A Li out-diffusion theory is suggested and correlated with the model. To support the Li out-diffusion theory, some additional experiments have been done.

All too often, however, these calls rely on technological or legislative measures, betraying an apolitical understanding of climate change and insufficient appreciation for the uneven global distribution of safety, risk, and power. Through an examination of recent events in Cuba and Venezuela, this article asks how prevailing calls for energy transitions to post-carbon futures reflect the combined and uneven present, replicating the inequalities of late carbon capitalism. By considering the 'Special Period in Times of Peace' in Cuba, as the decade following the collapse of the Soviet Union was known, and Venezuela's overlapping crises since 2014 as energy transitions, this article highlights difficulties along the path to more sustainable and just futures. It also calls to attention the intensely social, but potentially incomplete and reversible, nature of energy transitions.","[Kingsbury, Donald, V] Univ Toronto, Munk One Program, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kingsbury, Donald, V] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Kingsbury, DV (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Munk One Program, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Kingsbury, DV (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",donald.kingsbury@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,,2,2,2,7,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Members eschewed many forms of technology, lived collectively, harbored stray animals, and strove toward an entirely raw food diet in a communal lifestyle that many today would label 'simple living' or 'primivitist.' They rejected fashion and cosmetics, demonstrated for animal liberation as well as against police brutality, militarism, prisons, and pollution of land, water, and air. Notably, John Africa and MOVE emphasized the need to maintain sobriety and break with personal addictions in order to achieve personal and societal balance. Yet, rather than a set of 'single issues' strung together, John Africa formulated an all-encompassing paradigm. This article presents John Africa's paradigm as well as his grassroots decolonial semiotics that critically deconstructed, qualified, repurposed, and refrained conventional English language terms toward emancipatory and radically egalitarian ends. This paradigm, based on 'Mother Nature' and oneness, aligned with (without overtly borrowing from) many Indigenous and Aboriginal paradigms that similarly locate human life as interwoven with habitats and nonhuman animals Whether or not one agrees with his ideas or approach, John Africa and the organization he co-founded seem to clearly qualify as early pioneers of degrowth.

This study explored interpretations of growth and degrowth in a local setting and attempts to integrate degrowth ideas into local policy. The work was carried out as a qualitative single-case study of the small town of Alingsas, Sweden. The results revealed two different, yet interrelated, local growth discourses in Alingsas: one relating to population growth and one relating to economic growth. Individuals participating in the degrowth discourse tend to have a sustainability-related profession and/or background in civil society. Arenas for local degrowth discussions are few and temporary and, despite some signs of influence, degrowth-related ideas have not had any significant overall impact on local policy and planning. In practice, degrowth-interested individuals tend to adjust their arguments to the mainstream sustainability discourse and turn to arenas beyond the formal municipal organization when discussing transformative ideas about development, progress, and quality of life. Based on these findings, the conditions for a further integration of degrowth into local policy and planning are discussed.

The construction of housing is responsible for a huge share of global energy and resource consumption, and its overall contribution is only likely to increase due to the intensifying pace of urbanization. Recent arguments about housing for degrowth focus primarily on the advantages of community-based and grassroots housing provision, but overlook the systemic role of public and private sector actors in producing and exchanging housing under a degrowth scenario. This contribution to the debate about housing for degrowth makes the case for integrating research on home swapping, which means a permanent exchange of housing units between two households without house-hunting. Home swapping addresses many of the ecological, economic, and social goals inherent to the debate and at the same time stimulates a more systemic research agenda by going beyond stand-alone micro-scale projects.","[Kitzmann, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Econ Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Kitzmann, R (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Econ Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",robert.kitzmann@geo.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,,0,0,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,SEP 14,2022,43,8,,,,,1231,1239,,10.1080/02723638.2022.2093503,0,,JUL 2022,9,Geography; Urban Studies,,Geography; Urban Studies,4S7JQ,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000819748400001,0,en

In essence, degrowth calls for a proactive renewal of technology use around goals of voluntary simplicity and slowing-down, community-based coproduction and sharing, alongside conscious minimalization of resource consumption. The paper considers how core degrowth principles of conviviality, commoning, autonomy and care have been used to develop various forms of 'radically sustainable computing'. The paper then suggests four ways in which degrowth principles might frame future thinking around education technology in terms of: (i) curtailing current manipulative forms of education technology, (ii) bolstering existing convivial forms of education technology; (iii) stimulating the development of new convivial education technologies; and (iv) developing digital technologies to achieve the eventual de-schooling of society. It is concluded that mobilisation of these ideas might support a much-needed reorientation of digital technology in education along low-impact, equitable lines.","[Selwyn, Neil] Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Melbourne, Australia; [Selwyn, Neil] Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Clayton Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University; Monash University,"Selwyn, N (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Clayton Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",neil.selwyn@monash.edu,,,,,,,,1,1,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,LEARN MEDIA TECHNOL,Learn.

Rapid and uneven expansion of tourism as a response to the 2008 economic crisis has proceeded in parallel with the rise of social discontent concerning so-called overtourism. Despite decades of concerted global effort to achieve sustainable development, meanwhile, socioecological conflicts and inequality have rarely reversed, but in fact increased in many places. Degrowth, understood as both social theory and social movement, has emerged within the context of this global crisis. Yet thus far the vibrant degrowth discussion has yet to engage systematically with the tourism industry in particular, while by the same token tourism research has largely neglected explicit discussion of degrowth. We bring the two discussions together here to interrogate their complementarity. Identifying a growth imperative in the basic structure of the capitalist economy, we contend that mounting critique of overtourism can be understood as a structural response to the ravages of capitalist development more broadly. Debate concerning overtourism thus offers a valuable opportunity to re-politicize discussion of tourism development generally. We contribute to this discussion by exploring of the potential for degrowth to facilitate a truly sustainable tourism.","[Fletcher, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Murray Mas, Ivan] Univ Illes Balears, Earth Sci Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Blanco-Romero, Asuncion] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Bellaterra, Spain; [Blazquez-Salom, Macia] Univ Illes Balears, Earth Sci Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Wageningen University & Research; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Fletcher, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands.",robert.fletcher@wur.nl,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTI2018-094844-B-C31]","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government)","This article was supported by the research project Overtourism in Spanish coastal destinations: Tourism degrowth strategies (RTI2018-094844-B-C31) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities.",,,100,101,9,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

While some argue that carbon markets represent a modern example of a Polanyian counter-movement to the environmental crisis, we adopt a structural interpretation of Polanyi to refute this claim. Carbon markets represent a further expansion of markets that fails to address the underlying contradictions related to the commodification of nature. In addition, they increase risks to society and the domination of economic elites. While carbon markets further subject social and ecological relations to market mechanisms, we examine degrowth as a possible response to climate change that prioritises social and environmental goals over economic growth. While degrowth continues to be dismissed as impractical or impossible, a growing number of scholars, scientists and activists argue it is the only way to address global climate change. In contrast to carbon markets, we argue degrowth could represent a genuine Polanyian counter-movement in response to climate change. In addition, degrowth could help all those disenfranchised by market fundamentalism by addressing the triple crises related to the commodification of land, labour and money.","[Stuart, Diana] No Arizona Univ, Sustainable Communities Program, 19 W McConnell,POB 6039, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Stuart, Diana] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, 19 W McConnell,POB 6039, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Gunderson, Ryan] Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Petersen, Brian] No Arizona Univ, Geog Planning & Recreat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; University System of Ohio; Miami University; Northern Arizona University,"Stuart, D (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sustainable Communities Program, 19 W McConnell,POB 6039, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.;Stuart, D (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, 19 W McConnell,POB 6039, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",diana.stuart@nau.edu,,,,,,,,24,24,6,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This involves a negative, individualistic and market-centred interpretation of the concept. In contrast, visions of a degrowth society offer a radical alternative based on Cornelius Castoriadis' notion of individual and social autonomy. We present both positions and explain their differences. We then follow this up by reporting on a questionnaire conducted at the 2018 Degrowth Conference in Malmo, Sweden. This empirical study of the degrowth movement probes the extent to which advocates actually follow the Castoriadian as opposed to the hegemonic neoliberal theory. While participants were found to hold positions consistent with the Castoriadian theory, we also identify contradictory and under-conceptualised aspects in their understanding of freedom. This points to the need for the degrowth movement to directly address its theoretical foundations, and elaborate on and strengthen its vision of freedom compatible with a future degrowth society in order to avoid potential co-option and becoming sub-hegemonic.","[Windegger, Felix] Eurac Res, Ctr Adv Studies, Bolzano, Italy; [Spash, Clive L.

Instead, unsatisfactory health trends, health systems' inefficiencies, and high costs are linked to the globalization of a growth society dominated by neoliberal economic ideas and policies of privatization, deregulation, and liberalization. A degrowth approach, understood as frame that connects diverse ideas, concepts, and proposals alternative to growth as a societal objective, can contribute to better health and a more efficient use of health systems. However, action for change of individual and collective behaviors alone is not enough to influence social determinants and counteract powerful and harmful market forces. The quality and characteristics of health policies need to be rethought, and public policies in all sectors should be formulated taking into consideration their impact on health. A paradigmatic shift toward a more caring, equitable, and sustainable degrowth society will require supportive policies at national level and citizens' engagement at community level. Nevertheless, due to global interdependence and the unavoidable interactions between global forces and national systems, a deep rethinking of global health governance and its reformulation into global governance for health are essential. To support degrowth and health, a strong alliance between committed national and global leaderships, above all the World Health Organization, and a well-informed, transnationally interconnected, worldwide active civil society is essential to include and defend health objectives and priorities in all policies and at all levels, including through the regulation of global market forces.","Univ Bocconi, CERGAS, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Missoni, E (corresponding author), Univ Bocconi, CERGAS, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management, Via Roentgen 1, Milan, Italy.",eduardo.missoni@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,,9,9,1,31,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Second, drawing on insights from Lancashire?s anti-fracking movement, we illustrate how sense of place became critical for actors involved in degrowth-minded activism. In doing this, our work contributes towards narrowing the gap between degrowth theorisations and the enactment of degrowth-minded activism within real world complexities.

Surprisingly little research has focused on the role of technology in connection to value change, consumption behavior and degrowth. This gap is linked to a widely held assumption of technological innovation acting contrary to degrowth. In contrast, this paper suggests that technological innovation needs to be connected to degrowth. In particular, the fast evolution of information and communication technologies in recent years points to their importance for the global civil society. Given the scope of sustainability challenges connected to these technologies and smartphones in particular, this paper argues that a degrowth movement going hand in hand with technological development is only made possible, if sustainable alternatives for highly demanded products are offered. Specifically, this study draws on lifestyle movements as the nexus between consumption, degrowth and technology. Three core concepts are found to influence the attendance to degrowth-related consumer movements: a sustainable lifestyle, alternative forms of consumption and social commitment, all of which are assumed to have a positive effect. Empirically this paper draws on the case of the Fairphone, a company that applies sustainable characteristics to a smartphone. Data collected in a survey via online fora of the Fairphone from November 4-29, 2015 are analyzed using a structural equation modeling with partial least squares. Results indicate that a sustainable lifestyle represents the dominant factor explaining the involvement with the Fairphone. Surprisingly, the findings show that alternative consumption seems to negatively influence the involvement with the Fairphone and social commitment seems to play a minor role in the model. These aspects point to the Fairphone as a technical artifact, centered on a choice for a sustainable lifestyle. Future research needs to reach clarification on the relationship of alternative consumption and degrowth related movements and whether the negative effect is case specific or beyond. Furthermore, future studies need to delve deeper into lifestyle decisions as a leverage point towards degrowth, especially on lifestyles understood as a from of activism to change contemporary society.

First, we have to make clear that, in the current political context, degrowth is nothing less than a complete heresy. Meadows and Whitehead are precious to specify its weak and strong concepts. On the one hand, degrowth is shown to be inevitable on a finite planet; on the other, technoscience lured by capitalism is necessarily alienating, as it prevents individuation, solidarity, and culture. Second, two forgotten political exemplifications are helpful to picture the critical practicalities: Cuba's special period, and the Mansholt Commission. Third, the status of technoscience being, arguably, at the very core of the (obvious) vices and (alleged) virtues of the growth religion, a brief Huxleyan speculation on its axiological neutrality helps us to conclude.","[Weber, Michel] Ctr Philosoph Practice, Brussels, Belgium; [Weber, Michel] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Educ Fdn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Weber, M (corresponding author), Ctr Philosoph Practice, Brussels, Belgium.;Weber, M (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Educ Fdn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,COSMOS PUBL COOPERATIVE,HAWTHORN,"C/O ARRAN GARE, PHILOSOPHY & CULTURAL INQUIRY, PO BOX 218, HAWTHORN, VIC 3122, AUSTRALIA",,,,COSM HIST,Cosm.

The paper lir argues that much of the reorientation work that is necessary to meet the goals of international climate change conventions needs to be carried out locally, in urban and regional settings, and this creates pressure to renew land-use planning practices. It also argues that in light of the latest carbon footprint studies the currently popular linking of urban planning motives with the doctrine of 'compactness policy' - which aims at urban core densification and accumulation of growth options - needs to be re-evaluated. The empirical part of the paper focuses on the inner city planning of Joensuu, a city in Eastern Finland with 75,000 inhabitants which has increasingly been criticised by some residents, civil servants and civic action groups for one-sided promotion of the central city. This is, according to critics, taking place at the cost of the surrounding countryside and peri-urban nodes. The paper illustrates how the 'tactics of growth' become manifest in the official local planning procedure and to what degree the planning critique, explicitly or implicitly, leans on degrowth concerns. The gathering of the empirical material progressed as part of my involvement in the local degrowth movement, Kohtuusliike, which actively participated in the preparation of the Central Joensuu General Plan 2012.","[Lehtinen, Ari Aukusti] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Lehtinen, AA (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",ari.lehtinen@uef.fi,,,,,,,,17,17,1,6,GEOGRAPHICAL SOC FINLAND,HELSINKI,"JUSTAF HALLSTROMIN KATU 2, DEPT GEOSCIENCES & GEOGRAPHY, PO BOX 64, HELSINKI, 00014, FINLAND",,,,FENNIA,Fennia,,2018,196,1,,,,,43,57,,10.11143/fennia.65443,0,,,15,Geography,,Geography,GH4WC,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000433404800005,0,en

Sputtering is a cost-effective and relatively straightforward growth technique for ZnO films; however, most as-grown films are observed to contain intrinsic defects which can significantly diminish the desirable UV-emission. In this research the defect dynamics and optical properties of ZnO sputtered films were studied via post-growth annealing in Ar or O-2 ambient, with X-ray diffraction (XRD), imaging, transmission and Urbach analysis, Raman scattering, and photoluminescence (PL). The imaging, XRD, Raman and Urbach analyses indicate significant improvement in crystal morphology and band-edge characteristics upon annealing, which is nearly independent of the annealing environment. The native defects specific to the as-grown films, which were analyzed via PI, are assigned to Zn-i related centers that luminesce at 2.8 eV. Their presence is attributed to the nature of the sputtering growth technique, which supports Zn-rich growth conditions. After annealing, in either environment the 2.8 eV center diminished accompanied by morphology improvement, and the desirable UV-PL significantly increased. The 02 ambient was found to introduce nominal O-i centers while the Ar ambient was found to be the ideal environment for the enhancement of the UV-light emission: an enhancement of similar to 40 times was achieved. The increase in the UV-PL is attributed to the reduction of Zn-i-related defects, the presence of which in ZnO provides a competing route to the UV emission. Also, the effect of the annealing was to decrease the compressive stress in the films. Finally, the dominant UV-PL at the cold temperature regime is attributed to luminescent centers not associated with the usual excitons of ZnO, but rather to structural defects. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We study visible luminescent defects in ZnO NRs as a function of post growth thermal treatments, and find four distinct visible deep level defect states (VDLSs): blue (2.52 eV), green (2.23 eV), orange (2.03 eV), and red (1.92 eV). Photoluminescence (PL) studies reveal a distinct modification in the UV (3.25 eV) emission intensity and a shift in the visible spectra after annealing. Annealing at 600 degrees C in Ar (Ar600) and O-2 (O600) causes a blue and red-shift in the visible emission band, respectively. All samples demonstrate orange emission from the core of the NR, with an additional surface related green, blue, and red emission in the As-Prep, Ar600, and O600 samples, respectively. From PL excitation (PLE) measurements we determine the onset energy for population of the various VDLSs, and relate it to the presence of an Urbach tail below the conduction band due to a presence of ionized Zn-i or Zn-i complexes. We measured an onset energy of 3.25 eV for the as prepared sample. The onset energy red-shifts in the annealed samples by about 0.05 to 0.1 eV indicating a change in the defect structure, which we relate to the shift in the visible emission. We then used X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) to understand changes in the surface structure, and H content, respectively. The results of the XPS and ERDA analysis explain how the chemical states are modified due to annealing. We summarize our results by correlating our VDLSs with specific intrinsic defect states to build a model for PL emission in ZnO NRs. These results are important for understanding how to control defect related visible emission for sensing and electroluminescence applications.","[Barbagiovanni, E.

The energy sector is at the core of any modern economy, and Germany serves as an international showcase for the transition of a large industrialized economy to a low-carbon energy system. Diverse actors, organizational models, and technologies have contributed to the initiation of Germany's energy transition through a wide range of community renewable energy projects. The think piece investigates how far these diverse actors embrace the aims of the Degrowth movement. It also provides a critical account of on-the-ground realities through six hypotheses and contrasts them with claims made by the Degrowth movement. It is suggested that community renewable energy projects are at a crossroads. While many projects have familiarized thousands of people with alternative economic models, there is little evidence of a general change in attitudes towards technology, consumption, or equity. In conclusion, a major effort is needed to open initiatives to less affluent actors, oppose recent trends of commodification, and prevent community renewable energy projects from being engrossed by the dominant political and economic system.

The share of crystals of octahedral habit together with individual crystals of transitional forms with sheaf-like and splintery striation is higher in the Arkhangelskaya pipe and makes 15 %. The share of cuboids and tetrahexahedroids is higher in the Karpinsky-I pipe and stands at 14 %. The share of dodecahedroids in the Arkhangelskaya and Karpinsky-I pipes are 60 % and 50 %, respectively. The indicator role of the nitrogen-vacancy N3 center active in absorption and luminescence is shown. Crystals with the N3 absorption system have predominantly octahedral habit or dissolution forms derived from the octahedra. Their thermal history is the most complex. Absorption bands of the lowest-temperature hydrogen-containing defects (3050, 3144, 3154, 3188, 3310 cm(-1), 1388, 1407, 1432, 1456, 1465, 1503, 1551, 1563 cm(-1)), are typical for crystals without N3 system, where in the absorption spectra nitrogen is in the form of low-temperature A and C defects. The above mentioned bands are registered in the spectra of 16 % and 42 % of crystals from the Arkhangelskaya and Karpinsky-I pipes, respectively. The diamond of the studied deposits is unique in the minimum temperature (duration) of natural annealing. Based on a set of features, three populations of crystals were distinguished, differing in growth conditions, post-growth, and thermal histories. The established regularities prove the multi-stage formation of diamond deposits in the north of the East European Platform and significant differences from the diamonds of the Western Cisurals. The results suggest the possibility of the existence of primary deposits dominated by diamonds from one of the identified populations.","[Vasilev, Evgeny A.] St Petersburg Min Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kriulina, Galina Yu.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Garanin, Victor K.] RAS, Fersman Mineral Museum, Moscow, Russia",Saint Petersburg Mining University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Vasilev, EA (corresponding author), St Petersburg Min Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",vasilev_ea@pers.spmi.ru,,,Russian Science Foundation;  [21-77-20026],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));,"Acknowledgments.

However, the calls for a 'genuine' socio-ecological transformation and for alternative bioeconomy visions imply exactly a destabilization of these power relations. Drawing on the Bielefeld subsistence approach and on its colonialism-capitalism-patriarchy nexus, I argue that the latest bioeconomy strategy and policy papers of both the EU and Estonia each disregard certain spheres of the bioeconomy due to the three-dimensional power relations. As a seemingly neutral political discourse, the bioeconomy is shaped by cultural assumptions and narratives that determine and perpetuate what is deemed worthy of protection and what is pushed aside as merely 'natural'. As such, the current bioeconomy papers promote a 'biomass-based model of capital accumulation' that is essentially built on the prerequisite of the subordination, devaluation, appropriation and/or exploitation of (1) different geographical regions, (2) ecological foundations, and (3) prevalent bioeconomy practices. As a widespread agricultural practice in Eastern Europe, Food Self-Provisioning (FSP) serves as a good example of how predominant bioeconomy models (1) simply operate as new forms of postcolonial development discourse, instead of embracing the plurality of decolonial 'alternatives to development'; (2) deepen the human-nature dichotomy by regarding nature as a mere resource to be extracted more efficiently instead of cultivating mutually nourishing partnership-like relation(ship)s with nature; and (3) maintain the separation between monetized and maintenance economies, rather than fostering ethics of care to overcome the structural separation between the latter.","[Pungas, Lilian] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Sociol, Jr Res Grp Flumen, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Pungas, L (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Sociol, Jr Res Grp Flumen, Jena, Germany.",lilianpungas@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2,2,4,4,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

In the present paper we link a discussion on degrowth and local energy projects, using two case studies from southern European islands, El Hierro in Spain, and Tilos in Greece. These pioneer local energy initiatives have a complex ownership model that includes various public and private actors, and aspirations that go beyond merely electricity production to other economic and social goals. We look into the promise of these initiatives in transforming insular areas and promoting an alternative way of living, comparing attributes of the processes involved to four degrowth principles. We conclude that despite the degrowth potential of these local energy projects, their prospects are limited to revitalizing local economies and empowering local communities, but not necessarily reducing energy use or creating an alternative to the growth orientation of the islands.","[Tsagkari, Marula; Roca, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Ave Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Kallis, Giorgos] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, ICTA UAB, Res & Degrowth, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Tsagkari, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Ave Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",marula.tsagkari@ub.edu,,,,,,,,10,10,3,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The basin hosts a high elevation (similar to 200 m) plateau (the Dasht-i Margo), 11 fluvial staircase terraces (T1l to Tl), 7 delta systems (D1 to D7), and 6 paleolake shorelines (SL1 to SL6) within the Sistan Depression on the western side of the basin. Mapping and surveying of these features by remote sensing is integrated with geological observations to reconstruct Quaternary landscape evolution of the basin. The fluvial systems, deltas, and paleolake shorelines are correlated with one another and with the younger terraces (T7 to T1). The shape of fluvial longitudinal profiles changes depending on whether they formed pre-, syn-, or post-growth of the Koh-i Khannesin volcano on the southern margin of the Helmand River. The age of the volcano (similar to 0.6 Ma) and correlation of the terraces with the global history of glacial-interglacial cycles constrain the age of the younger terraces to the late Pleistocene and indicates that the older terraces are middle Pleistocene (dating back to 800 ka). The Helmand Basin once hosted a large lake, called here the Sistan paleolake, which at SL6 times and before had a surface area >50,000 km(2). Since that time the lake elevation and area have decreased, evolving to the present-day dried out Sistan Depression with small ephemeral playa lakes. Episodic formation of terraces, deltas, and paleolake shorelines is attributed to changes in base level modulated by climate change related to Milankovitch cycles.

To keep global heating below 1.5 degrees C without overshoot by 2050, global CO2 emissions must decline by about half by 2030. To achieve rapid, early emission reductions entails substantially changing recent pre-COVID (2000-2019) observed trends, which comprise increasing total primary energy supply (TPES) and approximately constant fraction of TPES derived from fossil fuels (FF fraction). Scenarios are developed to explore the effects of varying future trends in these variables in the absence of substantial CO2 removal, because relying on the latter is speculative and risky. The principal result is that, to reduce energy-related emissions to at least half the 2019 level by 2030 en route to zero or near-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, either TPES must be reduced to at least half its 2019 value by 2050 or impossibly rapid reductions must be made in the FF fraction of supply, given current technological options. Reduction in energy consumption likely entails economic degrowth in high-income countries, driven by policies that are socioeconomic, cultural and political, in addition to technological. This needs serious consideration and international cooperation. Key policy insights If global energy consumption grows at the pre-COVID rate, technological change alone cannot halve global CO2 emissions by 2030 and hence cannot keep global heating below 1.5 degrees C by 2050. In the absence of substantial CO2 removal, policies are needed to reduce global energy consumption and hence foster degrowth in high-income economies. Policies to drive technological and socioeconomic changes could together cut global energy consumption and thus total primary energy supply and associated emissions by at least 75% by 2050.","[Diesendorf, Mark] UNSW Sydney, Sch Humanities & Languages, Fac Fac Arts Design & Architecture, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Diesendorf, M (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Humanities & Languages, Fac Fac Arts Design & Architecture, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.diesendorf@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,,3,3,6,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Given the socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene, the concept of CE could indeed help the transition to a sustainable, just and resilient future. However, the actual definition, objectives and forms of implementation of the CE are still unclear, inconsistent, and contested. Different actors and sectors are thus articulating circular discourses which align with their interests, and which often do not sufficiently examine the ecological, social and political implications of circularity. In this context, this research asks how to better navigate and analyse the history, complexity and plurality of circularity discourses by conceptually differentiating them in a comprehensive discourse typology. To answer this question a critical literature review has been carried out, which first, examines and reflects on the core challenges, gaps and limitations of the CE concept. Second, this research develops a comprehensive timeline of circularity thinking, which identifies and conceptually classifies 72 different CE-related concepts from the Global North and South (such as Gandhian and steady-state economics, buen vivir, doughnut economics and degrowth). This leads to the development of a typology of circularity discourses, which classifies circularity visions according to their position on fundamental social, technological, political and ecological issues. This research thus seeks to provide a basis for a more inclusive and comprehensive discussion on the topic, which opens the imaginary regarding the many circular futures that can exist and allows for a cross-pollination of ideas, policy options, strategies, practices and solutions.","[Friant, Martin Calisto; Vermeulen, Walter J.

Policymakers and scholars debate how best to decarbonise the energy system, and what socio-economic changes might be necessary. Here we review the strengths, weaknesses, and synergies of two prominent climate change mitigation narratives: the Green New Deal and degrowth. Green New Deal advocates propose a plan to coordinate and finance a large-scale overhaul of the energy system. Some see economic growth as crucial to financing this transition, and claim that the Green New Deal will further stimulate growth. By contrast, proponents of degrowth maintain that growth makes it more difficult to accomplish emissions reductions, and argue for reducing the scale of energy use to enable a rapid energy transition. The two narratives converge on the importance of public investments for financing the energy transition, industrial policies to lead the decarbonisation of the economy, socializing the energy sector to allow longer investment horizons, and expanding the welfare state to increase social protection. We conclude that despite important tensions, there is room for synthesizing Green New Deal and degrowth-minded approaches into a 'Green New Deal without growth'.","[Mastini, Riccardo; Kallis, Giorgos] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA UAB, Barcelona, Spain; [Kallis, Giorgos] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Hickel, Jason] Goldsmiths Univ London, London, England",Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Mastini, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA UAB, Barcelona, Spain.",riccardo.mastini@uab.cat,,,"la Caixa Foundation [ID100010434, LCF/BQ/IN18/11660059]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [713673]; 'Maria de Maeztu' Unit of Excellence [MDM-2015-0552]; COSMOS grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Business (MINECO) [CS0201788212-R]",la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); 'Maria de Maeztu' Unit of Excellence; COSMOS grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Business (MINECO),The project that gave rise to these results received the support of a fellowship from la Caixa Foundation (ID100010434).

Numerous governmental ministries and supranational organisations have produced sustainable consumption plans. However, actual programmatic initiatives have been limited to modest information and education campaigns as policy proposals are constrained by political contexts. Researchers have documented flows of materials and energy, but have disregarded the political and economic dynamics that animate throughput movements. Inattention to factors that propel the global metabolism, scholarship largely failed to anticipate the ongoing global financial collapse. Work on the household economics and macroeconomics of consumption is reviewed and an international political economy of (un)sustainable consumption is developed. Realignment of the global economic order will require renegotiation of the tacit agreements that the USA strikes with its trading partners and the design of more efficacious systems of production and consumption.","New Jersey Inst Technol, Grad Program Environm Policy Studies, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",New Jersey Institute of Technology,"Cohen, MJ (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Grad Program Environm Policy Studies, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",mcohen@adm.njit.edu,,,,,,,,10,11,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

This happens as we are part of cultures and economies that operate out of the growth ideology.

Rather, the growth ideology results in growing social inequalities and increasing ecological injustices around the world. Social work can, instead,embrace an ecosocial lens and promote degrowth approaches for transformational alternatives. Rather than reinforcing the existing systems of injustice and oppression, radical social work can take an activist role and bring about urgent and radical changes to promote ecological justice through social and ecological well-being.

Since its origins in the late 18th century, growth economics has expanded significantly in recent decades, leading to the development of ecological economics, political economics and growth and degrowth economics. It is apparent that humankind is now running out of time to develop a global consensus as to what approaches should be taken to transition from growth to zero growth and degrowth. Zero growth is the grand challenge of this century, particularly for the Asia-Pacific region where economic growth has been an imperative for emerging economies. Using Japan as an illustrative example, this article explores the scenario of a no-growth economy that is now confronted with potentially a zero-growth or even a degrowth future. The grand challenge for not just Japan but the entire Asia-Pacific region is how to survive a zero-growth future. Furthermore, this article also identifies emerging themes for future research to progress the zero-growth and degrowth discussions.

I explain how a Du Boisian approach furthers our understanding of racial and global inequalities in the development and impacts of global warming and in the production of fossil fuels, as well as how racism can shape climate inaction.

The COVID-19 global pandemic is an 'unprecedented crisis' and has exposed the pitfalls of a hyper consumption model of economic growth and development. The scale of immediate economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has shattered the myth of 'catch up development' and 'perpetual growth'. The Crisis has brought unintended degrowth, presenting opportunities for an economic and social 'reset'. In terms of long-term thinking post COVID-19, it is time to change the parameters of how we imagine a trajectory going forward, to prefigure possibilities for contesting capitalist imperatives that 'there is no alternative'. In relation to tourism, the pandemic provides an opportunity for reimaging tourism otherwise, away from exploitative models that disregard people, places, and the natural environment, and towards a tourism that has positive impacts. Non-western alternatives to neo-colonial and neoliberal capitalism, such the South American concept of 'Buen Vivir', can help us to shift priorities away from economic growth, towards greater social and environmental wellbeing, and meaningful human connections. Taking a Buen Vivir approach to tourism will continue the degrowth momentum, for transformative change in society within the earth's physical limits. Yet Buen Vivir also redefines the parameters of how we understand 'limits'. In limiting unsustainable practices in development and tourism, a focus on Buen Vivir actually creates growth in other areas, such as social and environmental wellbeing, and meaningful human connection. Buen Vivir can reorient the tourism industry towards localised tourism, and slow tourism because the principles of Buen Vivir require these alternatives to be small-scale, local and benefiting host communities as well as tourists to increase the wellbeing for all.","[Everingham, Phoebe] Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Chassagne, Natasha] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Tasmania,"Everingham, P (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.;Chassagne, N (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Phoebe.Everingham@newcastle.edu.au; Natasha.Chassagne.utas@edu.au,,,,,,,,94,97,14,94,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,TOURISM GEOGR,Tour.

Social phenomenology looks beyond individual mutual exchange to the rich but fragile social construction of collectively negotiated ethical purpose. Intentional communities of cohousing are identified as part of a solution to dismantle privatized, conspicuous consumption.

Economic growth is often taken for granted when planning for the future. However, it is often argued that maintaining economic growth conflicts with keeping human activities adjusted to ecological boundaries and finite resources, at least for the more-developed countries. With this paper, we present sustainability goals for building and planning in Sweden to be achieved by 2050 in a context of limited or even negative economic growth. These goals should ensure that all groups in society have sufficient resources and a good life within planetary boundaries. We select four goals in a participatory process: two environmental goals related to climate change and land use and two social goals related to welfare and participation. Our results show that achieving the environmental goals will require significant reductions of Sweden's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use compared to today's levels. Regarding the social goals, these are, in many aspects, reasonably well fulfilled in Sweden today, although disparities remain between groups of citizens. The main challenge, however, is to ensure that these goals are fulfilled even within environmental limits and if economic growth should halt.","[Faure, Eleonore; Svenfelt, Asa; Finnveden, Goran] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Environm Strategies Res, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hornborg, Alf] Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Human Geog, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hornborg, Alf] Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Human Ecol Div, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Lund University; Lund University,"Faure, E (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Environm Strategies Res, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",eef@kth.se; asa.svenfelt@abe.kth.se; goran.finnveden@abe.kth.se; alf.hornborg@hek.lu.se,,,Formas,Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Financial support from Formas is gratefully acknowledged.

Degrowth represents a much safer way, relying on a steep reduction in energy and materials consumption, starting with developed countries. Consequently, the concept of degrowth should be implemented within European Union (EU) energy law to reach its net zero target by 2050. This academic article is the first to use the theoretical framework of degrowth to analyse EU energy law. To do so, it focuses on various core energy laws: the 2019 Electricity Market Directive, the 2018 Renewable Energy Sources Directive and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive (slightly amended in 2018) as well as the recast proposals for the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency directives tabled in the 2021 Fit for 55 package and 2022 REPowerEU plan. This research shows that various degrowth-compatible provisions already exist in EU energy law and can be harnessed in the short term, without waiting for a legal overhaul. This article also formulates recommendations, such as interpreting in a degrowth-favourable way the aforementioned provisions and challenging the current as well as forthcoming framework, for instance by amending the proposed 'energy efficiency first' principle to include energy sufficiency.

In order to transform the structures and root causes underlying the interconnected crises, it is necessary to go beyond feminist demands for the inclusion of diverse women and for gender equality and rely more on feminism as an analytical tool: a way of asking questions that denaturalize received wisdom and that make visible the ways in which gendered meanings play a formative role in shaping the concepts and paradigms that constitute knowledge of our world.","[Cohn, Carol] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Duncanson, Claire] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Scotland",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Edinburgh,"Cohn, C (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",carol.cohn@umb.edu; c.p.duncanson@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Grounded in the degrowth literature, this paper asks how the European Union measures progress, economic development and the relevance of environmental protection. Specifically, this article aims at tracing degrowth elements in the Horizon 2020 program, i.e. the research and innovation agenda and funding scheme of the Union, which constitutes one of the European Union's major instruments for steering economic development. Employing a frame analysis this research detects a minor agenda pointing beyond conventional growth perspectives; however, conventional growth remains the central focus in the Horizon 2020 framework even where green growth measures are discussed. This research shows that this pattern is especially evident in technology policy and schemes related to information and communication technology in particular. The article reflects on the rationales for why the European Union pursues only a minor degrowth agenda. It points to a neoliberal meta-frame and to the effects of path dependency related to the Union's common market conceived of as a driver of prosperity. Finally, the paper identifies comparative policy analysis as a promising area for deeper integration of degrowth theory in political science research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We outline the context of the Croatian EJ movement through two specifics - the country's semiperipheral position in the global world-system and the ecological distribution conflicts (EDCs) characteristic of the post-socialist societal metabolism in Europe. The research explores the theory-practice nexus, materialist vs. post-materialist value base, and the potential of 'a politico-metabolic reconfiguration' (ibid.) for the proposed alliance. Our findings indicate a hitherto limited, but positive potential for degrowth to provide a theoretical framework for the semiperipheral EJ movement. Both the EJ movement and degrowth demonstrably share a materialist motivation, but not for reasons of 'under-development' of semiperipheral societies. Our analysis concludes that semiperipheral EJ activists are open to a politico-metabolic reconfiguration proposal, though they are presently not aware that a viable reconfiguration strategy is proffered by the degrowth research community. On the European semiperiphery, an alliance between theory and movement would benefit from a clearer explication of such a strategy.","[Domazet, Mladen] Inst Polit Ecol, Preobrazenska 2-3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Ancic, Branko] Inst Social Res Zagreb, Amruseva 11-2, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute for Social Research Zagreb,"Domazet, M (corresponding author), Inst Polit Ecol, Preobrazenska 2-3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mladen@ipe.hr; branko@idi.hr,,,Institute for Social Research in Zagreb,Institute for Social Research in Zagreb,"This research did not receive and specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

[Boatner et al. (2017)]. These precipitates form during Bridgman or other melt-growth processes, even at low Eu2+ concentrations (e.g., 0.1% EuI2 doping), and scatter the scintillation light reducing the optical transparency of the scintillator and adversely affecting its radiation-detection performance. In our prior work, we developed a two-stage thermal-treatment method for the post-growth removal of the Suzuki Phase particles and the realization of a significant improvement in the optical transparency and associated neutron-detection of LiI:Eu2+ scintillators. These improvements resulted in neutron-detection performance that is superior to GS-20 glass and that allows for the application of pulse height gamma-ray discrimination over a wide range of gamma ray energies as opposed to pulse shape discrimination. Here, we apply the two-stage thermal-processing method for the removal of Suzuki phase precipitates and carry out an in-depth study, first, of the neutron scintillator performance versus the Eu2+ activator-ion-concentration spatial variation as a result of zoning effects during the Bridgman growth of LiI: Eu2+ and, second, of the effects of varying the initial Eu2+ activator ion concentration prior to crystal growth. The Eu2+ zoning variation results allow one to identify and select the most efficient location of the scintillation performance in a directionally solidified single-crystal boule. The present study of the initial activator concentration levels shows that there are, in fact, two distinct types of luminescence centers with varying performance properties - one that occurs only at low EuI2 addition levels (e.g., 0.01 to 0.06 %EuI2) and that is quickly replaced by a second luminescing center with increasing Eu2+ content (e.g., at similar to 0.1%EuI2). The light yield for the luminescing center formed using a Eu activator in LiI is a critical function of the Eu concentration in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 % EuI2, and a high light yield of 100,000 photons/neutron is observed at the 0.06 % EuI(2)additive level prior to thermal processing.","[Boatner, L.

This article challenges the perceived inevitability of Amazon's growth. Linking questions of harm mitigation and economic governance, it shows how the various struggles being waged against Amazon point to an emergent counterhegemonic vision for Amazon, one marked by worker power, surveillance abolition, and ecological degrowth. This approach nests contingent organizing opportunities within a comprehensive vision of social transformation, assimilating seemingly conflicting reform paths.

J,"Albert, MJ",,,,"Albert, Michael J.",,,The Dangers of Decoupling: Earth System Crisis and the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution',GLOBAL POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The question of whether global capitalism can resolve the earth system crisis rests on the (im)possibility of 'absolute decoupling': whether or not economic growth can continue indefinitely as total environmental impacts shrink. Ecomodernists and other techno-optimists argue for the feasibility of absolute decoupling, whereas degrowth advocates show that it is likely to be neither feasible in principle nor in the timeframe needed to ward off ecological tipping points. While primarily supporting the degrowth perspective, I will suggest that the ecomodernists have a wildcard in their pocket that hasn't been systematically addressed by degrowth advocates. This is the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', which refers to convergent innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and other developments. However, I will argue that while these innovations may enable some degree of absolute decoupling, they will also intensify emerging risks in the domains of biosecurity, cybersecurity, and state securitization. Overall, these technologies will not only place unprecedented destructive power in the hands of non-state actors but will also empower and incentivize states to create a global security regime with unprecedented surveillance and force mobilization capacities. This reinforces the conclusion that mainstream environmental policies based on decoupling should be reconsidered and supplanted by alternative policy trajectories based on material-energetic degrowth, redistribution, and technological deceleration.","[Albert, Michael J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Albert, MJ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,,8,9,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,GLOB POLICY,Glob.

It incorporates vacant housing to the public housing stock, develops a special unit for attending evictions and other residential emergencies, and introduces support for promising yet marginal tenure forms such as co-housing or leasehold estate. However, a critical analysis of this policy reveals strong contradictions and limitations. Given the existing uneven socio-spatial dynamics of a global city such as Barcelona, the well-established power relations in the production of urban space, and the still-dominant discourse of austerity, the local government's actions remain precarious. However, albeit both promising and contradictory, Barcelona's housing policy proves to be a useful case for developing degrowth planning principles and tools for urban housing policy and beyond.",,,,lauramarlonso@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4,4,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,APR 3,2022,27,4,,,SI,,487,501,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1931075,0,,MAY 2021,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,0Y7TC,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000654051500001,0,en

Technologies addressed are solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries. A literature review of CE and Degrowth fields culminates in a 45 CE strategies framework being merged with two 'convivial technology' design tools, identified in Degrowth literature, creating a 'CE-Conviviality design tool'. This tool facilitates a CE-conviviality criteria comparison, finding weaknesses in CE design approaches; and four contributions from conviviality - power distribution, equity and autonomy; localization; relatedness; and sufficiency. These contributions are applied to RE technology and their circular systems; identifying RE designers' strategies for action to foster growth independence and social wellbeing. The article calls for balance between design for internationalized/industrial technology and localized, convivial technologies - and end-of-life systems. Designers can promote: technology distributed through open-source technology, adaptable to multiple contexts; 'relatedness' - bolstering social wellbeing; and low-tech and sufficiency-based business models - the ultimate balance to international/industrial supply chains. Long-term, designers can collaborate internationally/nationally with policy and supply chain stakeholders to design technology for 'local' production/maintenance in specific geographical areas (e.g. countries), according to locally available materials or expanding CE systems; reducing reliance on monopolistic international supply chains.","[Ralph, Natalie] Deakin Univ, ARC Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Electromat Sci, 221 Burwood Highway, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia; Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, Alfred Deakin Inst Citizenship & Globalizat, 221 Burwood Highway, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University; Deakin University,"Ralph, N (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, ARC Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Electromat Sci, 221 Burwood Highway, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia.",ralphnatalie8@gmail.com,,,Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence Scheme [CE 140100012]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science,Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence Scheme(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science(Australian Research Council),"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors but has been conducted under funding from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence Scheme (Project Number CE 140100012).

Understanding the causes of this persistent failure is a necessary step towards more effective action. This article contributes to that understanding by synthesizing theory and evidence that links unsustainable production-consumption systems to power and inequality. While sustainable consumption and production research and action mostly focuses on technological or behavioral change, the socio-ecological inequalities driving production-consumption systems built into the organization of our global political economy, remain largely overlooked. In response, we propose a structural political economy orientation that seeks explicitly to reduce these inequalities and advance environmental justice and, thus, create the conditions for sustainable production-consumption systems. We then propose three important arenas of research and action towards sustainable production-consumption systems: justice, governance, and co-production of knowledge and action. These arenas, collectively and individually, can serve as entry points to study and act on the dynamics of (un)sustainable production-consumption systems. This can be done at the micro level, with respect to specific commodity chains or systems of provisioning, or at meso and macro levels with respect to national and global production networks. Our proposed orientation helps distinguish research and practice proposals into those emphasizing management and compensation resulting often in persistence of unsustainability, from those proffering structural changes in unsustainable production-consumption systems. We invite critique and collaboration to develop this research and action agenda further.","[Mathai, Manu, V] Azim Premji Univ, Pixel Pk A,PESIT Campus,Hosur Rd, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India; [Isenhour, Cindy] Univ Maine, Dept Anthropol, 5773 S Stevens Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Stevis, Dimitris] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 200 West Lake St, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Vergragt, Philip] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, 56 Cloverdale Rd, Newton, MA 02461 USA; [Bengtsson, Magnus] Kamisoshigaya 4-2-3-114,Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1570065, Japan; [Lorek, Sylvia] Sustainable Europe Res Inst Germany eV, Cologne, Germany; [Mortensen, Lars Fogh] European Environm Agcy, Kongens Nytorv 6, DK-1050 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Coscieme, Luca] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Scott, David] Colorado State Univ, 501 11th St, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Waheed, Ambreen] Responsible Business Initiat, 66-1 Abid Majeed Rd, Lahore, Pakistan; [Alfredsson, Eva] KTH, Environm Strategies Res Fms, Royal Inst Technol, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",PES University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Colorado State University; Clark University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Trinity College Dublin; Colorado State University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Mathai, MV (corresponding author), Azim Premji Univ, Pixel Pk A,PESIT Campus,Hosur Rd, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India.",manu.mathai@apu.edu.in; cynthia.isenhour@maine.edu; dimitris.stevis@colostate.edu; pvergragt@outlook.com; bmbengtsson@gmail.com; sylvia.lorek@t-online.de; Lars.mortensen@eea.europa.eu; coscieml@tcd.ie; David.Scott@colostate.edu; ambreen.waheed@gmail.com; evaalf@kth.se,,,,,,,,14,14,6,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Furthermore, under stay-at-home orders and with bricks-and-mortar retailers closed, consumers were also forced to adapt. Thus the pandemic offers a unique opportunity to study shifts in behaviour during disruption to industrialised manufacturing and economic contraction, in order to understand the role peer-to-peer production may play in a transition to long-term sustainability of production and consumption, or degrowth. Here, we analyse publicly-available datasets on internet search traffic and corporation financial returns to track the shifts in public interest and consumer behaviour over 2019 - 2020. We find a jump in interest in home-making and small-scale production at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as a substantial and sustained shift in consumer preference for peer-to-peer e-commerce platforms relative to more-established online vendors. In particular we present two case studies - the home-made facemasks supplied through Etsy, and the decentralised effort s of the 3D printer community - to assess the effectiveness of their responses to the pandemic. These patterns of behaviour are related to new modes of production in line with ecological economics and as such add capacity to a broader prefiguration of degrowth. We suggest an adoption of a new fourth wave of DIY culture defined by enhanced resilience and degrowth to continue to add capacity to a prefigurative politic of degrowth.

Since that time, neoliberal capitalism has become increasingly reliant on growth exacerbating these problems. The destructive outcomes of these strategies has led to a growing interest in degrowth. Analysts are examining how we can create economies that eschew a growth imperative while still supporting human thriving. Tourism as a key facet of capitalism is implicated in these issues and recent concerns with overtourism are only one symptom of the problem. This article presents a conceptual consideration of issues of degrowth in tourism. It examines current tensions in international mobility and argues just and sustainable degrowth will require greater attention to equity. This analysis suggests that essential to such an agenda is redefining tourism to focus on the rights of local communities and a rebuilding of the social capacities of tourism.

The studied material represents almost pure fluorapatite with minor amounts of other cations (mainly Sr, Mn, REE and Fe), OH and Cl. Particular interest was given to the distribution of rare earth elements with respect to the crystallographic orientation. A broad range of analytical techniques were used, including optical microscopy coupled with cathodoluminescence imaging, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), Raman microspectroscopy, and simultaneous thermal analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. The investigated crystal consists of the main crystal with a distinct core and rim (Ap(2core) and Ap(2rim), respectively), which grew on a previous, euhedral crystal (Ap(1)). The fluorapatite demonstrates various types of zoning: regular oscillatory, irregular, and internal sectoring, which is also reflected in trace elements concentrations. The rim Ap(2rim) has lower concentrations of Mn, Sr and Fe, and significantly higher concentrations of REE compared to the core Ap(2core) and older crystal Ap(1). Furthermore, the rim Ap(2rim) is strongly depleted in Th, U and Pb. The entire crystal shows elevated Eu contents, expressed as a strong positive anomaly in chondrite-normalized REE patterns. With regards to the volatiles, F concentrations are constant in Ap(1), Ap(2core) and Ap(2rim), whereas Cl is below the EPMA detection limit. The Ap(2rim) was the only part of the investigated material containing OH and CO3, which were observed in the Raman spectra. Furthermore, part of the crystal Ap(2core) is extensively altered, likely due to fluid-induced metasomatic processes. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating yielded highly discordant dates due to common Pb content. A lower intercept age of 297 +/- 13 Ma (MSWD = 0.13) indicates the age of the fluorapatite crystallization. The overall analytical data constrain growth and post-growth processes, including crystallization of Ap(1) and Ap(2core), which both have typical hydrothermal Sn-W deposit characteristics, whereas Ap(2rim) is related to a carbonate stage of the mineralization in the Panasqueira deposit.","[Jaranowski, Maciej; Budzyn, Bartosz] Polish Acad Sci ING PAN, Res Ctr Krakow, Inst Geol Sci, Senacka 1, PL-31002 Krakow, Poland; [Rzepa, Grzegorz] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Geol Geophys & Environm Protect, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Slama, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Rozvojova 269, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic; [Sawlowicz, Zbigniew] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Geol Sci, Gronostajowa 3a, PL-30087 Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geological Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences; AGH University of Krakow; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Jagiellonian University,"Jaranowski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci ING PAN, Res Ctr Krakow, Inst Geol Sci, Senacka 1, PL-31002 Krakow, Poland.",ndjarano@cyf-kr.edu.pl,,,ING PAN Research Funds [16.16.140.315]; ASCR [RVO67985831],ING PAN Research Funds; ASCR(Czech Academy of Sciences),"This work was partially supported by the ING PAN Research Funds (projects Orogen and Petrochron, to B.B.) , AGH Research Grant No 16.16.140.315 (to G.Rz.) and the ASCR institutional support RVO67985831 (to J.S.) .

How can peace and environmental sustainability be advanced simultaneously? To address these questions, I develop a new conceptual and theoretical framework for climate resilient peace through degrowth. This paper calls for stronger consideration of positive conceptualizations of peace and of intersectionality and degrowth in pursuit of peace and resilience. Not only does climate change make planetary limitations more salient, but it also highlights rising inequalities. In light of this, peace necessitates transforming societal power structures that are both driving climate change and influencing people's experiences of climate impacts. Addressing imbalanced power structures then is key to understanding and fostering climate resilient peace. This paper conceptualizes climate resilient peace based on an intersectional understanding of positive peace, highlighting that peace depends on the negation of structural violence experienced at the intersection of political and social identities. In relation to this, I argue that a process of climate resilient peace must address underlying power structures influencing people's experience of climate harms, and driving climate change so as to mitigate further damage. This paper demonstrates such a process through degrowth, wherein growth is no longer the central economic goal, exemplifying social and ecological means for disrupting structural violence within climate limitations. I discuss and give examples of three key degrowth processes-redistribution, reprioritized care economies, and global equity-as opportunities to foster peace in a changing climate. This framework, thus, contributes a new approach to climate resilient peace that addresses challenges of both social and environmental sustainability.","[Nicoson, Christie] Lund Univ, Statsvetenskapliga Inst, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nicoson, Christie] Lund Univ, Statsvetenskapliga Inst, Agenda Grad Sch 2030, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Nicoson, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Statsvetenskapliga Inst, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Nicoson, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Statsvetenskapliga Inst, Agenda Grad Sch 2030, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christie.nicoson@svet.lu.se,,,Lund University,Lund University,Open Access funding provided by Lund University.,,,4,4,1,6,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Conversely, degrowth rejects the EM belief in green growth, and holds that it will not be possible to decouple the economy from environmental loads to the necessary extent if the economy keeps growing. We conclude that we need a fundamental transformational change in society, i. e., a steering away from the growth ideology, and pursue policies that introduce maximum housing standards and limit mobility to succeed with the goals of the Paris agreement.","[Xue, Jin; Naess, Petter] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, N-1430 Akershus, Norway; [Walnum, Hans Jakob; Aall, Carlo] Western Norway Res Inst, N-6856 Sogndal, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Walnum, HJ (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, N-6856 Sogndal, Norway.",jin.xue@nmbu.no; hjw@vestforsk.no; caa@vestforsk.no; petter.nass@nmbu.no,,,National Energy Agency of Norway (ENOVA),National Energy Agency of Norway (ENOVA),We acknowledge the National Energy Agency of Norway (ENOVA) for financing the project Scenarios of a Norwegian low emissions society.

J,"Thompson, AJ",,,,"Thompson, Andrew James",,,Growth and degrowth: Dewey and self-limitation,EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dewey; growth; Hegel; Bildung; degrowth; Castoriadis; paideia,,"This paper explores John Dewey's debt to Hegel by examining the relationship between his conception of growth and Bildung. Dewey's notion of the progressive subject takes the project of education as unending-it is both a personal and collective process that strives to synthesise competing social values democratically. Despite Dewey's rejection of absolutism and idealism, his teleological commitment to democracy reveals his tendency to revert to Hegel's philosophical ideals. Although Dewey was aware of capitalism's power to eclipse the advance of democracy, the Deweyan subject is no less a rational actor than homo economicus, making educational and democratic growth easily susceptible to market forces. This examination questions the extent to which our contemporary understanding of educational growth, inherited from Dewey, grounds itself in self-limitation-a quality that is central to the degrowth movement. This paper will evaluate whether Dewey's concept of growth is compatible with economic degrowth and its understanding of finite natural resources and the environmental dangers of capitalist expansion. An answer lies in the philosophy of Cornelius Castoriadis, who contended that self-limitation is essential for democracy to thrive and for the character of the social imaginary to shift. As we face a global environmental crisis, this shift is necessary. This article investigates whether Bildung, growth, and Castoriadis' concept of paideia are all the same idea by different names, equally prone to neoliberal 'reconciliation' or able to penetrate the current dominant imaginary towards degrowth.","[Thompson, Andrew James] Univ Auckland, Fac Educ, Sch Crit Studies Educ, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Thompson, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Educ, Sch Crit Studies Educ, Educ, N Block Level 3,Gate 4, Auckland 1023, New Zealand.",andrew.thompson@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,,0,0,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,EDUC PHILOS THEORY,Educ.

This study investigates in detail how seismically induced deformation microstructures in zircon correlate with trace element and isotope re-equilibration. Felsic mylonites with pseudotachylyte veins from the Ivrea-Verbano Zone in Northern Italy were studied with special focus on deformed zircon. We have revealed the following post-growth deformation microstructures: planar deformation bands (PDBs), planar fractures (PFs), non-planar fractures (both healed and open), and finite strain patterns. PDBs are planar portions of crystal lattice that are strictly parallel to {100} crystallographic planes, and are rotated to up to 3 degrees with respect to the host grain. They are from 0.5 to 1 mu m wide and have average spacing of 5 mu m. PDBs originate in seismically active environment at elevated differential stress, strain rate and temperature. Several grains, in which PDBs are observed, were analyzed with ion microprobe. Ion maps indicate redistribution of radiogenic Pb isotopes associated with PDB formation. Isotopic redistribution preferably occurs in PDBs with larger crystallographic misorientation. Profiling demonstrated clear spatial correlation of PDBs with variations of REE abundances (both gain and loss), and possible correlations with increased and decreased Hf, Ti, and P abundances. Trace elements can be depleted or enriched (compared to the abundance in surrounding matrix) in deformed domains, depending on the spacing of PDBs and the proximity of the analyzed volume to grain boundary or to detrital core. Pb-207/Pb-206 ratio demonstrates systematic Pb-loss in the PDB-bearing lattice domains with respect to PDB-free domains; in some cases Pb-gain is observed, where the PDBs source radiogenic Pb from older detrital cores. Our study has important implications for geochronology and microchemistry of zircon from seismically deformed sections of Ivrea-Verbano Zone and from other paleo-seismic zones of the world. Zircon found in seismically deformed rocks near pseudotachylyte veins may demonstrate distorted and even reset isotopic ages, and altered trace element abundances. Enhanced trace element exchange between deformed zircon and host mylonite can influence mass-balance calculations for the bulk rock.","[Kovaleva, Elizaveta] Univ Free State, Dept Geol, 205 Nelson Mandela Dr, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Kovaleva, Elizaveta; Kloetzli, Urs] Univ Vienna, Fac Earth Sci Geog & Astron, Dept Lithospher Res, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of the Free State; University of Vienna,"Kovaleva, E (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Geol, 205 Nelson Mandela Dr, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.;Kovaleva, E (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Earth Sci Geog & Astron, Dept Lithospher Res, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",kovalevae@ufs.ac.za,,,University of Vienna (doctoral school DOGMA) [IK 052],University of Vienna (doctoral school DOGMA),"This study was funded by the University of Vienna (doctoral school DOGMA, project IK 052).

With cruise tourism halted as a result of the COVID-19, but likely to resume in 2021, I question the relevance of this form of tourism and propose future development alternatives aligned with deglobalisation and degrowth of the industry. Power relations with destinations communities can be critiqued using the concepts of global mobility and local mobility to show that the former, imperative for the deployment of mass cruise tourism, is a weakness for the industry in a post-pandemic perspective of reduced mobility. Destinations must use the industry's dependence on global mobility as leverage to transform the balance of power in their favor and promote local mobility. They must embrace radical solutions to take control of their territory to favor a transition from Growth for development to Degrowth for liveability. Host territories, relying on national and regional governance, should gradually ban or restrict the arrival of mega-cruise ships, implement policies that promote the development of a niche cruise tourism industry (NCTI) with small ships and develop a fleet controlled by local actors.","[Renaud, Luc] Univ Quebec, Dept Etud Urbaines & Tourist, Grp Rech & Intervent Tourisme Terr & Soc GRITTS, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Renaud, L (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Etud Urbaines & Tourist, Grp Rech & Intervent Tourisme Terr & Soc GRITTS, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",renaud.luc@uqam.ca,,,,,,,,77,78,7,106,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,TOURISM GEOGR,Tour.

However, societal support for a degrowth transition remains for the time being moderate, and it is not well understood as yet why this is the case. This article argues that Pierre Bourdieu's sociology can help theorize societal stability and transformational change as well as the preconditions for a degrowth transition. The point of departure is the structure/action debate in sociology highlighting Bourdieu's middle-ground position. Using his theory of practice, it moves on to analyze the predominating correspondence between structure, habitus, and action as well as the preconditions under which this correspondence may break and result in transformational change. Subsequently, his distinction of doxa, orthodoxy, and heterodoxy is applied to understand possible solutions to the multidimensional crisis of contemporary European societies. The last section addresses Bourdieu's take on the role that researchers and activists may play during such a transition. The article concludes that in order to facilitate degrowth, formulations of eco-social policy strategies should avoid overburdening people's experiences and immediate expectations of the future. Deliberative citizen forums can help co-develop and upscale such initiatives as well as broaden their social basis.","[Koch, Max] Lund Univ, Socialhogskolan, Lund, Sweden; [Koch, Max] Lund Univ, Socialhogskolan, Allhelgona Kyrkogata 8, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Koch, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Socialhogskolan, Allhelgona Kyrkogata 8, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",max.koch@soch.lu.se,,,,,,,,12,12,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-SCI P,Sustainability-Sci.

These consequences affect the rights of the local population, and favour global processes such as Climate Change. In light of this situation, numerous voices are calling for a slowdown in the growth of tourism. They are even calling for its degrowth. The strategy of the tourism sector has been to put forward discourses and actions aimed at preventing the application of limitations to its activity. This article focuses on an action promoted by the UNWTO: the aim to turn tourism into a human right. First, the text offers a critical analysis of what this idea is based on and the debate it has generated. It then investigates its motives. The work concludes that by legitimizing tourism as a supposed human right, it would allow the debate to centre on a conflict of rights (the right of the citizen as a tourist against the rights of the citizen as a resident of a territory or as a worker). Because a debate between rights always ends up in stalemate. This way, degrowth proposals in tourism would be neutralized.","[Gascon, Jordi] Univ Lleida, Dept Hist Art & Social Hist, Catalonia, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"Gascon, J (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, Dept Hist Art & Social Hist, Catalonia, Spain.",jordigascon@hahs.udl.cat,,,,,,,,21,21,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

However, the spatiotemporal relationship between development zone construction and urban land growth is still unclear. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal changes of national-level development zones (NDZs), approximately 219 national economic development zones, and 156 high-tech development zones during 1990-2018 in China. The impact of development zone establishment on the growth of surrounding urban land was quantitatively explored using circle buffering analysis and time series comparative analysis. The results show that China's NDZs spread from the southeast coast to the inland area from 1990 to 2018, and the establishment of the development zones has an obvious promoting effect on the surrounding urban land growth. The scope and intensity of influences of the development zone established in different periods present distinct nonstationarity in space and time. Overall, the impact on urban land (IU) of China's NDZs established in different years was mostly highest at the 100 m buffer zone radius, while the slope of the IU was mostly negative, which meant that the 100 m buffer zone radius of the development zone center was the most efficient scale to promote urban land growth. In the meantime, the curve of IU of NDZs established before 1990, during 1996-2000 and 2001-2005 has a clear inflection point, which indicates that the most efficient scales of NDZs established before 1990, during 1996-2000, and 2001-2005 are 1300 m, 900-1000 m, and 800 m, respectively. NDZs established in other periods do not have the most obvious efficient scale. The development zone played the greatest role in promoting urban land growth from 2000 to 2010. Three association modes, including post-growth, pre-growth and steady-growth, were identified based on the differences in geographical location, establishment time, and type of development zones. We quantitatively identify the impact of the growth pole of NDZs on urban land growth from the perspective of spatiotemporal evolution. The findings would provide decision-making support for optimizing the spatial relationship between development zone construction and urban land growth.","[Wang Zhihan; Kong Xuesong; Cheng Peng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Kong Xuesong] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Kong, XS (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;Kong, XS (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",wangzh0219@whu.edu.cn; xuesongk@whu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFD1100801],National Key Research and Development Program of China,"The National Key Research and Development Program of China, No.2018YFD1100801",,,2,2,16,40,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

Drawing from Herbert Marcuse and Guy Debord, we illustrate how production drives consumption, how advertising promotes false needs and excess, how these power relations are concealed, and how they undermine social and ecological well-being. Specific to climate change, continued widespread support for increasing levels of production and economic growth will undermine efforts to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming.

Current efforts to solve this global challenge are fragmented, fixating on single issues rather than on a 'whole-of-system' approach. To address this, we have used a novel approach combining systems thinking and network analysis to map out food packaging use in food systems. This process draws from experts across the Australian food system. We report three main results. First, the resulting Causal Loop Diagram sheds light on the experts' mental models about food packaging use. Second, current interventions fail because they tackle the symptoms of the problem and not the drivers. Third, the ten most influential food packaging drivers are presented and belong to the globalisation and household subsystems. The findings highlight that dependence on packaging is a symptom of the growth-driven globalised food market and time-deprived society. Finally, we demonstrate that shifting the current food systems towards economic degrowth principles could potentially curb the use of food packaging. Under a degrowth framework the need for packaged food could be reduced by eliminating the tension between cooking and working time constraints. Designing for a not-for-profit food economy and re-localising it would also reduce the need for packaging.","[Chakori, Sabrina; Hudson, Nicholas J.; Aziz, Ammar Abdul] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Richards, Russell; Smith, Carl] Univ Queensland, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Richards, Russell] Griffith Univ, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; Griffith University,"Chakori, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",sabrina.chakori@uq.net.au,,,Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",We acknowledge the financial support provided by Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.,,,0,0,4,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Thus the realisation of values such as autonomy or recognition has been facilitated by economic growth and material expansion. Yet there is mounting evidence that the human impact on natural systems at the planetary level, a novelty captured by the concept of the Anthropocene, endangers the Earth's habitability. If human development is to be limited for the sake of global sustainability, can emancipation be kept as a mobilising ideal? As opposed to alternative views such as that of degrowth, this article argues that it can. The key lies in the ability of the Anthropocene to produce planetary subjectivities. By recognising the bounded quality of human embeddedness, the possibility of a different emancipation is opened up. The latter does not give up material well-being, yet it makes sure that the latter does not endanger planetary habitability.","[Arias-Maldonado, Manuel] Univ Malaga, Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Arias-Maldonado, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Derecho, Dept Polit Sci, Campus Teatinos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",marias@uma.es,,,,,,,,4,4,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

I illustrate that these rates exceed the planetary boundary formulated by Rockstrom et al. (2009) virtually everywhere and increase with population density and GDP per capita. Likewise, the percentage of threatened species increases with anthropogenic pressure. I find no evidence in support of an Environmental Kuznets Curve.

Their strategy has generally been to either reject the formal market system as a whole and experiment with alternative practices outside markets or suggest changes in the policies that regulate markets. They have paid less attention to potential changes in market cultures. This paper seeks to foster the cultural transformation of current market-nature relations while retaining the radical core of degrowth. The paper presents an investigative practice that was found in an ethnographic study of an evolving forest-based market in Finland. The practice seems to have the potential to disrupt habitual ways of approaching nature and of turning it into exchangeable and consumable objects. According to practice theory, this kind of disruption creates space for emerging alternatives to the dominant practices. In this sense, the investigative practice works similarly to an environmental shock, without the harmful material effects. In addition, the investigative practice involves a critical approach that supports a transition toward sustainable market-nature relations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the tourism industry is not a homogenous entity, but is instead characterized by diverse forms of distinct tourisms. In Ecuador, the Kichwa Anangu Community has chosen to dedicate their livelihood to community-owned tourism. Anangu owns and operates two lodges, whose management and oversight are administered through communal governance. As a result, tourism is locally embraced as a vehicle for livelihood wellbeing, cultural reclamation, and environmental stewardship. Community-owned tourism will not provide a cure-all answer to the critiques levied against tourism or to the vulnerabilities inherent in the practice of tourism. However, Anangu's project offers a compelling case study for considering how certain tourisms could become a vehicle for developing a localized degrowth society. The Anangu have decentralized the value placed upon profit in the practice of tourism, replacing it with Kichwa forms of communal organizing guided by their goal for Sumak Kawsay, or the good life. For the Anangu, the sustainability of their project cannot be separated from its economic viability, however, success is also measured by how tourism contributes to a number of community-defined goals.","[Renkert, Sarah Rachelle] Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, Emil W Haury Anthropol Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Renkert, SR (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, Emil W Haury Anthropol Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",sarahrenkert@email.arizona.edu,,,"Kichwa Anangu Community, Yasuni-Amazona; Tinker Foundation; Willian and Nancy Sullivan Scholarship Fund; Graduate & Professional Student Council at the University of Arizona; Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology; School of Anthropology at the University of Arizona","Kichwa Anangu Community, Yasuni-Amazona; Tinker Foundation; Willian and Nancy Sullivan Scholarship Fund; Graduate & Professional Student Council at the University of Arizona; Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology; School of Anthropology at the University of Arizona","This research was generously funded by the Kichwa Anangu Community, Yasuni-Amazona, the Tinker Foundation, the Willian and Nancy Sullivan Scholarship Fund, the Graduate & Professional Student Council at the University of Arizona, the Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology, and the School of Anthropology at the University of Arizona.",,,15,16,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

The current global economic system focuses on persistent growth and a top-down approach to wealth distribution, which not only puts a strain on the Earth's resources but also on communities by increasing vulnerability. Localised economy, on the other hand, uses a bottom-up approach to wealth distribution, whereby local resources are harnessed for sustainability of the local economy. Localising economies facilitate degrowth by shifting our focus to the quality of economies and the redefinition of growth and prosperity. The purpose of this study is to highlight the potentials of localisation and degrowth for vulnerability reduction. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors conducted a case study of the Lyttelton community in New Zealand, their local initiatives and how these efforts have been used to build capacities and reduce vulnerabilities in the community. Data were sourced from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were sourced through observation of the day-to-day running of the community and interviews with community members, while secondary data were sourced from existing literature on the community and related concepts. Findings Lyttelton community provides a good example of a community where bottom-up initiatives are particularly felt, and there is very limited dependence on the conventional economic system to solve their problems. The study shows that degrowth initiatives within the community have gained momentum because initiators see the value in their coming together as a community and doing what is right for themselves and the environment. Furthermore, localisation fosters innovation, personal growth and development and care for the environment. Originality/value This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by discussing some local initiatives that serve an underlying purpose for degrowth based on a study carried out in Lyttelton, New Zealand. The study findings established that there is need for more focus on sensitisation about the risks of growth mania and the potential for degrowth in bringing about actual prosperity, for saving the environment and disaster risk reduction. Also, the encouragement of local production and existing institutions like the timebank, which give members access to the needed resources and skills contribute to vulnerability reduction.","[Ajulo, Oluwadunsin Moromoke; Tang, Patrick] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [von Meding, Jason] Univ Florida, Florida Inst Built Environm Resilience, Gainesville, FL USA",University of Newcastle; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ajulo, OM (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",oluwadunsin.ajulo@uon.edu.au; jasonvonmeding@gmail.com; patrick.tang@newcastle.edu.au,,,University of Newcastle International Postgraduate Scholarship,University of Newcastle International Postgraduate Scholarship,This research was funded by the University of Newcastle International Postgraduate Scholarship.,,,4,4,2,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",,,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

It focuses primarily on how wind propulsion technologies, both old and new, aim to close the 'emissions gap' between projected emissions and the target to reduce them, as set by the International Maritime Organization in 2018. In doing so, it questions whether and how wind propulsion technologies could help attain 'absolute decoupling' of GHG emissions from industry growth, resulting from growing demand for shipping. It concludes that wind propulsion can help decarbonize the industry. But there is lack of certainty regarding the possibility to (a) deploy zero-emission technology at scale and (b) the extent to which reducing demand for shipping activity may suffice to attain full decarbonization. This article argues that a combination of both technological innovation and reduced demand is crucial to developing a decarbonization pathway for the shipping industry to meet Paris Agreement commitments at scale and in time. Key policy insights Wind propulsion can contribute to a decarbonization pathway for the shipping industry This technology can be pursued from both 'ecomodernist' and 'degrowth' perspectives It is unlikely that either technological innovation or reduced demand alone will bring down shipping emissions to net-zero quickly enough, thus a combination of both may need to be considered to meet emissions reductions targets","[De Beukelaer, Christiaan] Univ Melbourne, Fac Arts, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"De Beukelaer, C (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, John Medley Bldg,Room X351, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",Christiaan.DeBeukelaer@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,,2,2,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

When social welfare accounts for intragenerational equity, the larger the intragenerational inequality aversion (IIA), the smaller the sacrifice asked of the poor country, but the lower the sustained level of generational welfare.

In the case of thin films, however, well-designed reduction annealing alone without Ce doping can induce superconductivity in the T'-type cuprates. In order to unveil the origin of superconductivity in the Ce-undoped T'-type cuprates, we have performed bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission and soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy on superconducting and nonsuperconducting Nd2-xCexCuO4 (x = 0, 0.15, and 0.19) thin films. By postgrowth annealing, core-level spectra exhibited dramatic changes, which we attributed to the enhancement of core-hole screening in the CuO2 plane and the shift of chemical potential along with changes in the band filling.

Expanding economies and industries create wealth and employment, but global economic expansion is having unprecedented deleterious impacts on vital planetary systems. Despite this, the core strategic goal of all economies and many businesses continues to be the pursuit of ongoing economic growth. To resolve this paradox, a reconceptualization of firm-level growth is presented. I describe and discuss the organizational characteristics of the growth paradox and follow this with a metatheoretical review of economic, organizational, and ecological perspectives on growth. From this review, a typology of firm-level strategy is developed that radically reconceptualizes business growth as developmental activity primarily concerned with social-ecological flourishing. The features of this typology and its implications for business strategy are discussed according to three principles that emerged from the analysis: multidexterity, resilience thinking for design, and inclusive balance (embeddedness). Together, these strategy principles form the prerequisite management competencies needed for the development, implementation, and evaluation of sustainable business strategies. Transformative firm-level responses to the growth paradox are needed if sustaining forms of organizational growth are to be achieved and this paper presents a novel integrative framework for informing those strategies.","[Edwards, Mark G.] Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Media Management & Transformat Ctr, Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Edwards, MG (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Media Management & Transformat Ctr, Jonkoping, Sweden.",mark.edwards@ju.se,,,,,,,,9,9,21,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

While a single heterointerface is easily formed by oxide deposition on a crystalline semiconductor, as in MOS transistors, the amorphous structure of most oxides inhibits epitaxy of a second semiconductor layer. Here, we overcome this limitation by separating epitaxy from oxidation, using postgrowth oxidation of AlP segments to create axial and core shell semiconductor-oxide heterostructured nanowires. Complete epitaxial AlP-InP nanowire structures were first grown in an oxygen-free environment. Subsequent exposure to air converted the AlP segments into amorphous aluminum oxide segments, leaving isolated InP segments in an oxide matrix. InP quantum dots formed on the nanowire sidewalls exhibit room temperature photoluminescence with small line widths (down to 15 meV) and high intensity. This optical performance, together with the control of heterostructure segment length, diameter, and position, opens up for optoelectrical applications at room temperature.","[Wallentin, Jesper; Vainorious, Neimantas; Mergenthaler, Kilian; Samuelson, Lars; Pistol, Mats-Erik; Borgstrom, Magnus T.] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Ek, Martin; Wallenberg, L.

Moving beyond theory and the construction of the degrowth proposal, the articles in this special issue look at particular applications, new methodologies and fresh policy options. For example, social enterprises are evaluated as primer candidates for a sustainable degrowth economy in the North. Lessons are also drawn from very different parts of the world, such as Cuba's experience with an oil and commodity shock, to which it adapted through the introduction of ecological labour-intensive agriculture in urban regions. This Special Issue approaches from a degrowth perspective important sectoral issues in agriculture, resource consumption and water. The unsustainable fuel-dependence of the Spanish agrarian sector, where the energy input for the production process is six times higher than the energy contained in finished food products, is analysed in the context of the industrialization of food production. Rather than efficiency, sufficiency (in consumption) is proposed as an organising societal principle and a call is made for stronger NGO action and coalition-building in the direction of absolute (rather than relative) consumption reduction. The obstacles to sufficiency policies are illustrated with a case-study on water in the city of Barcelona, where a growth discourse is still dominant and a source of a technological and institutional deadlock against softer, decentralized and more participatory forms of water management. Finally, many of the contributions in this issue focus on work. The policy option of a Job Guarantee scheme is examined as a tool to decouple jobs from economic growth and fiscal policy by bringing them to the realm of political rights. This is complemented by a discussion of the social benefits of an amateur economy through work-sharing and a socially beneficial reduction in labour productivity. Original data from Barcelona analysed for this Special Issue shows that household activities, an essential component of a more amateur economy, have a much lower intensity of energy use than the paid-sector delivery of equivalent services, especially government and privatized caring services. Interesting research questions are identified concerning work under a degrowth trajectory, not least whether reducing paid work will be possible in an energy-scarce future. Put together, the diverse contributions of this issue show that there is a vibrant and fertile degrowth research agenda with a range of open questions to which the community of this journal has much to offer.

The Anthropocene then shifts scientific debate from the technical to the political, thus forcing science to change its mode of inquiry from normal to post-normal science, where political stakes as well as uncertainty of decision outcomes are high, and pressuring science to become a political actor. The current understanding of the Anthropocene, both stratigraphically and metaphorically, is based on the detrimental ecological impact of humanity and this leads us to propose that the Anthropocene commences with a new age we have called the 'Auxocene', after the ancient Greek Horae of growth. We argue that the social imaginary constituting the Auxocene rests on an unchallenged basic driver: expansionist differentiation and unchecked growth. We explore the notion of 'Degrowth' as a powerful discursive tool to facilitate the emergence of new social imaginaries and creating new socio-economic models that will provide beneficial ecological consequences for living in the Anthropocene.","[Reichel, Andre] Int Sch Management, Stuttgart, Germany; [Perey, Robert] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Reichel, A (corresponding author), Int Sch Management, Stuttgart, Germany.",andre.reichel@ism.de,,,,,,,,14,14,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

Environmental psychology has traditionally focused on the underlying barriers towards more pro-environmental behaviours. Emotions-like fear or anger-may act as such barriers especially in case of radical change (e.g., degrowth). While minority influence has been extensively applied to understand societal change, it has rarely been applied to understand the emotional responses that may hinder counter-normative pro-environmental messages. However, past literature on emotions shows that, in challenging situations-the likes of radical minority conflict-people will tend to use their emotional reaction to maintain societal status quo. Two studies investigated how participants emotionally react towards a counter-normative pro-environmental minority message (advocating degrowth). A qualitative (thematic analyses) and a quantitative (emotional self-report paradigm) studies showed that participants report emotions that allow them to realign themselves with the cultural backdrop of the social dominant paradigm (growth), thus resisting change. Specifically, although all participants tend to demonstrate higher proportions of control-oriented emotions, men do so more. These effects, as well as questions of cultural and ideological dominance, are discussed considering barriers towards pro-environmentalism.","[Avery, Robert A.

Responses such as the '10 Year Framework of Programmes on Consumption and Production Patterns' (10YFP)-an outcome of the 2012 Rio+20 Summit-suggest that nothing short of highly coordinated and multilevel concerted efforts are required to begin to address such trends. However, some commentators fear that the 10YFP will default to 'weak' forms of sustainable consumption intervention, focusing on efficiency and technological innovation. By contrast, many are calling for 'strong' interventions such as those expounded by the degrowth movement. With this paper I examine both these weak and strong approaches to sustainable consumption, and argue that-although this dichotomy describes two divergent streams of thought and practice-there are conceptual and practice-based spaces where they intersect. Along with a much-needed expansion of the geographical scope of current research and practice, I thus argue that these spaces present one way forward for work in this field.","Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Oxford,"Hobson, K (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",kersty.hobson@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,,46,47,0,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

My aim is to investigate how the different actors understand this compensation for non-production of oil in Ecuador, an oil dependent country. Using a chronological review of the Initiative and forty in-depth interviews with key players, I critically engage the 'environmental narrative' around the Initiative inspired by sumak kawsay -a philosophy of life based on non-mercantilist values, known as well living in English or buen vivir in Spanish- and degrowth. In this article I argue that understanding the Initiative as an environmental matter and not as a problem of oil rent dependency exemplifies the limits of sumak kawsay and degrowth as proposals for an alternative to development. Results from Yasuni show that the Initiative ended up reproducing the fictions of nature valuation instead of de-linking nature from the valuation process. By drawing on a critical political economic framework, this paper shows that categories such as dependency and rent are fundamental in understanding the challenges of moving away from extraction-based development in developing countries. In summary, failing to differentiate between payment for the non-production of oil and compensation from the environmental services, Yasuni was a A ' lost 'opportunity for a bottom-up debate on what to produce and what not.","[Gallardo Fierro, Lucia] ICTA, Edifici C,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Fierro, LG (corresponding author), ICTA, Edifici C,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",lucha.aleph@gmail.com,,,"Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENECYT)","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENECYT)","I want to mention deep thanks to Louis Lemkow for his supervision and constructive comments.

The end of the era of cheap and abundant energy flows brings the issue of economic growth into question, stimulating research for alternatives as the de-growth proposal. The present paper applies the system dynamic global model WoLiM that allows economic, energy and climate dynamics to be analyzed in an integrated way. The results show that, if the growth paradigm is maintained, the decrease in fossil fuel extraction can only be partially compensated by renewable energies, alternative policies and efficiency improvements, very likely causing systemic energy shortage in the next decades. If a massive transition to coal would be promoted to try to compensate the decline of oil and gas and maintain economic growth, the climate would be then very deeply disturbed. The results suggest that growth and globalization scenarios are, not only undesirable from the environmental point of view, but also not feasible. Furthermore, regionalization scenarios without abandoning the current growth GDP focus would set the grounds for a pessimistic panorama from the point of view of peace, democracy and equity. In this sense, an organized material de-growth in the North followed by a steady state shows up as a valid framework to achieve global future human welfare and sustainability. The exercise qualitatively illustrates the magnitude of the challenge: the most industrialized countries should reduce, on average, their per capita primary energy use rate at least four times and decrease their per capita GDP to roughly present global average levels. Differently from the current dominant perceptions, these consumption reductions might actually be welfare enhancing. However, the attainment of these targets would require deep structural changes in the socioeconomic systems in combination with a radical shift in geopolitical relationships.","[Capellan-Perez, Inigo] Univ Basque Country, Inst Econ Publ, Low Carbon Programme, Bilbao, Spain; [Mediavilla, Margarita; Javier Miguel, Luis] Univ Valladolid, Escuela Ingn Ind, Syst Engn & Automat Control, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [de Castro, Carlos] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Phys, Escuela Arquitectura, Valladolid 47014, Spain; [Carpintero, Oscar] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Valladolid, Spain",University of Basque Country; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Inst Econ Publ, Low Carbon Programme, Bilbao, Spain.",inigo.capellan@ehu.es,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) [CGL2009-14268]; University of the Basque Country; REPSOL Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ENE2010-19834, CSO2010-21979, HAR2010-18544]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN)(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); University of the Basque Country; REPSOL Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","This work has been developed within the project CGL2009-14268 funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN).

Tourism is one of the world's largest industries, and hence a powerful global political and socio-economic force. Yet numerous problems associated with conventional tourism development have been documented over the years, problems now greatly exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Calls for sustainable tourism development have long sought to address such issues and set the industry on a better course. Yet such calls tend to still promote continued growth as the basis of the tourism industry's development, while mounting demands for degrowth suggest that growth is itself the fundamental problem that needs to be addressed in discussion of sustainability in tourism and elsewhere. This critique asserts that incessant growth is intrinsic to capitalist development, and hence to tourism's role as one of the main forms of global capitalist expansion. Touristic degrowth would therefore necessitate postcapitalist practices aiming to socialise the tourism industry. While a substantial body of research has explored how tourism functions as an expression of a capitalist political economy, thus far no research has systematically explored what post-capitalist tourism might look like or how to achieve it. Applying Erik Olin Wright's 2019 innovative typology for conceptualizing different forms of post-capitalism as components of an overarching strategy for eroding capitalism to a series of illustrative allows for exploration of their potential to contribute to an analogous strategy to similarly erode tourism as a quintessential capitalist industry.","[Fletcher, Robert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Blanco-Romero, Asuncion; Sekulova, Filka] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Blazquez-Salom, Macia; Mas, Ivan Murray] Univ Illes Balears, Mallorca, Spain; [Canada, Ernest] ALBA SUD, Barcelona, Spain",Wageningen University & Research; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Fletcher, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands.",robert.fletcher@wur.nl,,,"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCI); Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Turismo de interior en Espana: Retos, valorizacion y estrategias ante situaciones cambiantesy de crisis para impulsar productos y destinos turisticos.

Even though the pragmatics of everyday life as an aggregate underlie the bulk of environmental impacts, these insidious impacts impose little immediate influence on everyday life, in particular in the urban Global North. In other words, the pragmatic dimension of everyday activities-principally, work-that takes place within a vastly complex and globally interlinked productive world system, has most often no immediate connection to the natural environment. While parts of the populations are directly dependent in terms of livelihoods on the natural environment, these populations are typically pushed to the margins of the global productive system. The understanding formulated in this essay suggests that in environmental social sciences there is a reason to shift the epicenter of the analysis from consumption to everyday life, to the varied practices of incomegetting. Against the backdrop of this paper, universal basic income schemes ought to have radical impacts on the way we relate also to the natural environment and such schemes necessitate understanding the essence of money in our contemporary realities.","[Ollinaho, Ossi I.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Arponen, V.

Until the 1970s the relation of energy to well-being was defined as linearly proportional, and in a later period still as an increasing logarithmic function. Recent empirical research falsified the assumption of an overt link between well-being and increased energy consumption in countries with high per-capita energy usage. Going forward, our research shows for the first time a possible proof for a negative correlation between energy consumption and well-being after a Well-being Turning Point (WTP). We used a world data set, not limited to high-income countries but including 176 nations with available data sets. Our findings could support both the logarithmic growth of well-being together with energy, as well as the contradicting saturation theses supporting degrowth, and thus opens the discussion in all directions. In this paper Energy Footprint data within Eora database and Global Multi Regional Input Output methodology have been calculated, which includes also the energy embodied in imported/exported products and services (also known as consumption-based energy accounts). The use of footprint accounts has been demonstrated in our previous research to be necessary when analysing global energy consumption trends; as it records the energy consumption reality better than the usually used Total Primary Energy Supply which is provided by the International Energy Agency. In this paper, we provide in a novel way, some statistical support for an Energy WTP, i.e. a high-energy threshold after which a further consumption increase results in a reduced Human Development Index. We tested our results for possible biases (e.g. excluding outlier countries and including a factor for considering the weight of high population countries) and concluded that a WTP is one possible interpretation of the data. Thus, we would like to open a discussion about how energy consumption could end up having a negative effect on well-being, considering its indirect impacts in citizens of a country.

An integrated assessment model has been developed to simulate energy transition scenarios considering constraints on oil availability at the national and global level. Results show that if current trends in energy demand and supply persist, energy scarcity would start around 2040 due to depletion of national oil reserves and restricted access to foreign oil. This would trigger a degrowth in economic activity in sectors with high dependency on petroleum products. Scenarios with conservative efforts might partially revert the increasing use of fossil fuels supported by policies for energy efficiency and substitution of liquid fuels with electricity mainly from renewables. However, energy shortages would still be foreseeable as well as a decay of the economy. Under a maximum efforts scenario with an optimistic availability of national oil, a moderate-sustained economic growth could be feasible. This shows that oil would still play a key role during the transition. Furthermore, ambitious policies must be implemented in the short term to smooth the effects of displacing oil as energy and income source.","[Sebastian Espinoza, Vicente; Fontalvo, Javier; Ramirez, Paola] Inst Invest Geol & Energet IIGE, Quito 170518, Ecuador; [Sebastian Espinoza, Vicente; Mediavilla, Margarita] Univ Valladolid, Escuela Ingn Ind, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Paseo Del Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [Marti-Herrero, Jaime] Univ Reg Amazon Ikiam, Biomass Resources Grp, Via Tena Muyuna,Km 7, Tena 150102, Ecuador; [Marti-Herrero, Jaime] Ctr Int Metodes Numer Engn CIMNE, Bldg Energy & Environm Grp, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Centre Internacional de Metodes Numerics en Enginyeria (CIMNE),"Espinoza, VS (corresponding author), Inst Invest Geol & Energet IIGE, Quito 170518, Ecuador.;Espinoza, VS (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Escuela Ingn Ind, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Paseo Del Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain.",sebastian.espinoza@geoenergia.gob.ec,,,,,,,,0,0,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,ENERGIES,Energies,OCT,2022,15,19,,,,,,,6938,10.3390/en15196938,0,,,25,Energy & Fuels,,Energy & Fuels,5G1RP,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000866783500001,0,en

Several theories in environmental sociology and economics-degrowth, steady-state economy, and agrowth-offer compelling arguments that environmental sustainability and continuous economic growth are incompatible. However, there is a shortage of empirical evidence about public opinion on the growth versus environment dilemma, despite its great relevance for the social legitimacy of governments' approach to the issue. In this article, we aim to narrow this research gap by applying multilevel models to data from the 2017 European Values Study (EVS). We find that the idea of sacrificing a certain level of growth for the sake of the environment receives high levels of support in most European countries. Nevertheless, within countries, we find clear indications of social divides in opinions regarding the growth versus environment dilemma: post-materialists, politically left-leaning people, the better-off, and the higher-educated are in favor of reduced growth, whereas materialists, right-wing individuals, and disadvantaged groups prioritize the economy over ecological concerns. At the country level, economic affluence is associated with greater support for reduced growth, irrespective of the differences in post-materialist values and the ecological situation. In practical terms, our results suggest that politicians can be bolder in promoting substantive environmental measures, even those that reduce growth.","[Gugushvili, Dimitri] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Gugushvili, D (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res CESO, Inst Social & Polit Opin Res, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",dimitri.gugushvili@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,,7,7,4,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,INT J COMP SOCIOL,Int.

The resulting environmental destruction has led to an unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss. Following large-scale losses of habitats and species, it was recognized that biodiversity is crucial to maintaining functional ecosystems. We sought to continue the debate on the contradictions between economic growth and biodiversity in the conservation science literature and thus invite scholars to engage in reversing the biodiversity crisis through acknowledging the impacts of economic growth. In the 1970s, a global agenda was set to develop different milestones related to sustainable development, including green-blue economic growth, which despite not specifically addressing biodiversity reinforced the idea that economic development based on profit is compatible with the planet's ecology. Only after biodiversity loss captured the attention of environmental sciences researchers in the early 2000s was a global biodiversity agenda implemented. The agenda highlights biodiversity conservation as a major international challenge and recognizes that the main drivers of biodiversity loss derive from economic activities. The post-2000 biodiversity agendas, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the post-2020 Convention on Biological Diversity Global Strategy Framework, do not consider the negative impacts of growth-oriented strategies on biodiversity. As a result, global biodiversity conservation priorities are governed by the economic value of biodiversity and its assumed contribution to people's welfare. A large body of empirical evidence shows that unlimited economic growth is the main driver of biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene; thus, we strongly argue for sustainable degrowth and a fundamental shift in societal values. An equitable downscaling of the physical economy can improve ecological conditions, thus reducing biodiversity loss and consequently enhancing human well-being.","[Moranta, Joan; Hidalgo, Manuel] CSIC, Ctr Oceanog Balears IEO, Ecosyst Oceanog Grp GRECO, I-07190 Palma, Balearic Island, Italy; [Moranta, Joan] Alimentta, Think Tank Trans Alimentaria, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Torres, Cati] Univ Illes Balears, Appl Econ Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Murray, Ivan] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Geog, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Hinz, Hilmar] UIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados IMEDEA, Dept Ecol & Marine Resources, Esporles, Spain; [Gouraguine, Adam] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK,"Moranta, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Oceanog Balears IEO, Ecosyst Oceanog Grp GRECO, I-07190 Palma, Balearic Island, Italy.",joan.moranta@ieo.es,,,[RTI2018-094844B-C31],,"The authors are grateful to J.

Dominant narratives and visions about the bioeconomy also fit into this line of thinking by giving a central role to technological problem solving and decoupling, the opportunities of sustaining economic growth and advancing the extended use of renewable resources. In 2020, major actors of the air transport industry under the frame of the Air Transport Action Group issued Waypoint 2050 a global, sector wide strategy to tackle climate change and halve CO2 emissions by the middle of this century. As we will establish in this paper, their sustainability strategies strongly rely on bioeconomic solutions such as sustainable air fuels and renewable energy, while their need to grow remains unquestioned. However, achieving sustainability is a wicked problem that needs clumsy solutions. And clumsy solutions only come about when highly different viewpoints are put on the table. Degrowth perspectives can most certainly enrich dialogues on sustainability transitions such as the current challenges the air transport industry faces. This paper aims to provide a critical review of Waypoint 2050, underlining why it is important for economists and policymakers to shift their understanding from pursuing endless growth toward Degrowth perspectives. We use the main arguments of Degrowth to interpret and analyse the air transport industry's climate strategy and reframe the discussions around sustainable aviation. Our goal is to show that Degrowth approaches can contribute to positively influencing the discourses of air transport by assessing the consequences of the sector and its reform strategy through diverse lenses. The discourse reflected in this paper would also be appropriate when applied to other top carbon producing industries and our assessment of air transport is not a directed criticism but rather an example on why business-as-usual scenarios need to be revisited.

This rejoinder scrutinizes some simple stylized fact and assesses the soundness of the broader arguments. The evidence suggests clearly that becoming wealthy and following prudent economic policies is the best path to improving population health, equity, and other progressive outcomes.

It argues current literature often misinterprets these core concepts, which can lead to a misunderstanding of Polanyi's general thesis. This paper uses the Carton (2018.

Third, the rule of ecological law must permeate all areas of law. Fourth, it should focus on radically reducing material and energy throughput. Fifth, it must be global, but distributed, using the principle of subsidiarity. Sixth, it must ensure fair sharing of resources among present and future generations of humans and other life.

The results show that a massive replacement of oil-fueled individual vehicles to electric ones alone cannot deliver GHG reductions consistent with climate stabilization and could result in the scarcity of some key minerals, such as lithium and magnesium. In addition, energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution.

A number of urgent challenges need to be confronted such as increasing uncertainty and unpredictability related to stronger dependence on a global market for food import, ongoing political unrest and environmental conflicts, increasing resource scarcity and climate warming making food production hazardous. There is an increased vulnerability with respect to food security for human societies, both in developing and developed countries. The food security dimension of access to healthy food is related to equality and poverty and is relevant for cities in the North via the segregation challenges. The food system issue is well-suited for assessing sustainable development since food provisioning is both a multiscale and cross-sectorial issue and thus addresses more than the three dimensions of social, economic and environmental sustainability. How is the planning for sustainable food strategies in urban regions in Europe concordant with the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Goals and with the transition towards sustainable futures? This paper deliberates on using the food system issues for sustainability transition, drawing on the forthcoming 2018 IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) work on pathways for sustainable futures and a recent survey of existing urban food system strategies. Against this background, some reflections are given relevant for the ongoing work on a local urban food strategy for the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. (C) 2018 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

This review analyzes the main theoretical definitions of both concepts, together with their potentials and limitations, emphasizing the differences between their meanings. A bibliographic search was carried out in the Web of Science database and other sources from official organizations of international relevance and authors referenced by them. The works providing substantive definitions of sustainability and sustainable development from a complexity theory perspective were selected for discussion throughout the article. The main results showed a strong criticism of the concept of sustainable development due to its imprecise definition, the emergence of the concept of sustainability in the debate of the 1990s and its consolidation in certain fields of knowledge, and the emergence of new alternatives to sustainable development such as degrowth and buen vivir.

The text provides a general literature review oriented towards indicating the link between the Millennial generation's economic standpoints and possible directions of evolution of the economic system in the Western world. An orientation towards the market and its economic system has become one of the distinctive features embedded in the portrait of the Millennials, who not only create the dominant social force of the Western world but also represent the first generation in which the majority question well-established market philosophies. The article considers the potential contribution of the Millennial generation to the further development of alternatives to traditional notions of growth. Until now, the evolution of the economic framework has been pushed forward mainly by policymakers and government representatives. System designers have shaped the desired outcomes via international agreements, internal policies, and the empowerment of different economic actors, driven by a belief in the long-term benefits of the capitalism-democracy nexus. However, this moment in history, in which such principles are being seriously questioned, creates a space for bottom-up processes and the reconfiguration of economic realities with a potentially transformative effect on the whole framework.","[Zachara-Szymanska, Malgorzata] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Int & Polit Studies, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Zachara-Szymanska, M (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Int & Polit Studies, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland.",malgorzata.zachara@uj.edu.pl,,,Priority Research Area Society of the Future under the program Excellence Initiative-Research University at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow,Priority Research Area Society of the Future under the program Excellence Initiative-Research University at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow,The open access license and publishing fee of the publication was funded by the Priority Research Area Society of the Future under the program Excellence Initiative-Research University at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow.,,,2,2,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,7,,,,,,,3784,10.3390/su13073784,0,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RL4DN,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000638926200001,0,en

De-growth or zero economic growth are discussed as possible solutions for mitigating climate change. The traditional economic growth model is increasingly challenged by the demand for sustained economic growth expressed in United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8 sustained economic growth (UN-SDG 8) and supported by the European Green Deal. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the general understanding of characteristics, effects and challenges of new economic growth ideas as well as their interlinkages with the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. Methods To address these challenges, a stylized dynamic General Equilibrium Model (GEM) was developed, which consists of two countries: an emerging, developing European country A and a developed European country B. Country A is assumed to grow, while country B shrinks. The model is based on artificial data sets. This approach was chosen to prevent the blurring of counterfactual comparison by country-specific effects of economic turbulences such as the Lehman crash or the economic break-in during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results The gross output of the emerging European country increases, whereas the output of the developed European country decreases according to the different growth strategies. The analysis reveals that a constantly widening gap between the emerging and the developed country is created. It can further be shown how this influences the relevant economic indicators (CO2 emissions, household budget, trade balance, utility and social welfare). Conclusions The analysis of the two-country stylized GE model makes distortions visible: insignificant gaps in the values and development of analyzed economic indicators become prevalent. The welfare gap affects the core of the traditional socio-economic system, because the development of the utility of the households is central for the stability of political processes. A sufficiency and subsistence sector may be an option to even out the welfare losses from the de-growth strategy of the traditional economic system to avoid that the de-growth gaps are perceived by the community as welfare losses which can endanger the realization of UN-SDG 8.","[Schloer, Holger] Forschungszentrum Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Schubert, Stefanie A.] SRH Univ Heidelberg, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Schlor, H (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",h.schloer@fz-juelich.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,,0,0,8,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

While in theory we might agree with the general claim of Jim Kane and Robert Idel `that a transition from coal to wind involves an enormous decrease in mined materials', we demonstrate that this claim is misleading. This article stresses five essential points to correct their analysis and calculations in order to offer approximations that are more accurate and, thus, revealing the extent of complications and problems facing real energy transition. This entails challenging the fossil fuel versus renewable energy dichotomy; critically interrogating data and research scope; acknowledging the realities of capitalism; paying closer attention to policy objectives; and recognizing the underexplored reality of green extractivism. This is done not only to encourage environmental and energy policy taking ecological crises seriously, but also-more immediately-to prevent the misuse and decontextualization of Jim Kane and Robert Idel's claims to advance the agendas of socially and ecologically destructive companies.","[Dunlap, Alexander] Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, Oslo, Norway; [Marin, Diego] European Environm Bur EEB, Brussels, Belgium",University of Oslo,"Dunlap, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, Oslo, Norway.",alexander.dunlap@sum.uio.no,,,,,,,,5,5,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

Green growth theory asserts that continued economic expansion is compatible with our planet's ecology, as technological change and substitution will allow us to absolutely decouple GDP growth from resource use and carbon emissions. This claim is now assumed in national and international policy, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we find that: (1) there is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth, and (2) absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C, even under optimistic policy conditions.

To do so, we'll outline five different policy routes that could potentially bring the means and goal in line. Those five policy routes are: (1) exceed 2 degrees C; (2) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C by economic de-growth; (3) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C by traditional mitigation only; (4) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C by traditional mitigation and widespread deployment of Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs); and (5) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C by traditional mitigation, NETs, and Solar Radiation Management as a fallback. In assessing these five policy routes, we rely primarily upon two moral considerations: the avoidance of catastrophic climate change and the right to sustainable development. We'll conclude that we should continue to aim at the two-degree target, and that to get there we should use aggressive mitigation, pursue the deployment of NETs, and continue to research SRM.","[Callies, Daniel Edward] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Pract Eth, 9500 Gilman Dr 0406, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Moellendorf, Darrel] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Callies, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Pract Eth, 9500 Gilman Dr 0406, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",danielcallies@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4,4,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,POLIT PHILOS ECON,Polit.

The empirical analysis was based on the fixed-effects gravity model estimation with the PPML (Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood) for bilateral green trade of world countries for 1990-2019. This study focused on two proxy environmental policy indicators: environment-related tax and energy intensity. The major findings were that, first, promotion of environment-related tax increases green exports among HIC (high-income countries) and, second, an increase in the green trade of a country depends on the energy intensity level of its trading partner countries in order to stabilize domestic demand and production. This result is shown to be significant and consistent within the trade between the same income groups. Thus, supporting the green growth strategy, empirical results suggest that LMY (low- and middle-income) countries have to promote environmental policies and green production processes to be competitive in the global market.","[Kang, Sung Jin; Lee, Sun] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Kang, SJ (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",sjkang@korea.ac.kr; sunlee@korea.ac.kr,,,BK21 FOUR (Fostering Outstanding Universities for Research) - Ministry of Education (MOE) of Korea; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea,"BK21 FOUR (Fostering Outstanding Universities for Research) - Ministry of Education (MOE) of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This research was supported by the BK21 FOUR (Fostering Outstanding Universities for Research) funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Korea and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea.,,,6,6,5,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1517,10.3390/su13031517,0,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6TP,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000615648200001,0,en

SDG 4's expanded vision of quality education for all extends to the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) Agenda's call for education that contributes to all of SDGs, and prepares students to 'transform our world'. From a critical perspective, this paper considers the incompatibility of endless (compound) economic growth and capital accumulation, under capitalism, with the required CO2 reductions that the climate emergency demands. The paper shows how the ESD proposals reflect the orthodoxy of education as human capital formation for economic development, albeit within a reformed 'green growth' model. At the same time, it argues that their distinctive ambitions and transformational language provide space for critical educators to simultaneously work with and against their contradictions and limitations, and to advance non-capitalist and degrowth alternatives.","[Griffiths, Tom G.] Oslo Metropolitan OsloMet Univ, Dept Int Studies & Interpreting, Oslo, Norway",,"Griffiths, TG (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan OsloMet Univ, Dept Int Studies & Interpreting, Oslo, Norway.",tomggrif@oslomet.no,,,,,,,,6,6,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,INT STUD SOCIOL EDUC,Int.

However, most studies either rely on the nation-state estimates of carbon emissions to propose a uniform nation-wide growth (or degrowth) strategy, or they tailor the method to assess the inequality of one country at a time, making a cross-country cross-income comparison difficult. To fill this analytical gap, we synthesize the existing methods of emission calculations and calculate the level of carbon emissions associated with given income deciles of household consumption in five countries, namely China, Germany, India, the UK and USA. We find that the within-country inequality varies among countries, with the ratio between the top and bottom income deciles ranging from three to nine at the household level. We also find that the carbon emissions of the top income group in urban China is almost comparable to that of their peer group in the US, UK and Germany. Based on these results, we discuss the use of the remaining global carbon budget in the context of development and inequality.","[Chen, Ying] New Sch Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Isikara, Guney] NYU, Dept Liberal Studies, New York, NY USA",The New School; New York University,"Chen, Y (corresponding author), New Sch Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",yingc@newschool.edu,,,,,,,,1,1,6,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Political ecologists, degrowth scholars, and Indigenous activists have critiqued these approaches on the grounds that by centering economic growth, they can disrupt local conservation systems and compromise forestdwelling communities' ability to protect forests and live well. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups have developed positive alternatives to 'green growth' strategies, including buen vivir (good living) in Latin America. In Peru, the National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) serves as the state's flagship initiative to address tropical deforestation in Indigenous communities by paying communities for demonstrated reductions in deforestation, so long as they invest those funds according to an agreed up on management plan. We analyzed how the NFCP has interacted with quality-of-life plans, Indigenous planning tools rooted in buen vivir. Our findings suggest that the NFCP has eroded local systems for conservation, including the minga, an Amazonian tradition of mutual aid and shared labor for subsistence livelihoods, pushing communities to replace these systems with commodity production and employer-employee relationships. We argue that instead of imposing onerous conditions and steering communities towards evermore commodity production, conservation initiatives should support the implementation of quality-of-life plans.

Research suggests that reduced working hours could contribute to sustainability by decreasing the scale of economic output and the environmental intensity of consumption patterns. Here, we investigate the effect of working hours on three environmental indicators: ecological footprint, carbon footprint, and carbon dioxide emissions. Using data for 19702007, our panel analysis of 29 high-income OECD countries indicates that working hours are significantly associated with greater environmental pressures and thus may be an attractive target for policies promoting environmental sustainability.

Some advocate a more inclusive stakeholder model of capitalism. Others caution that this would be insufficient to deal with our pre-pandemic crises of income inequality and climate change. Many countries emphasize a 'green recovery' with improved funding for health and social protection. Progressive tax reform and fiscal policy innovations are needed, but there is concern that the world is already tilting towards a new round of austerity. Fundamentally, the capitalist growth economy rests on levels of material consumption that are unsustainable and inequitable. More radical proposals thus urge 'degrowth' policies to reduce consumption levels while redistributing wealth and income to allow the poorer half of humanity to achieve an ethical life expectancy. We have the policy tools to do so.

An important theoretical perspective within environmental sociology, it is also the intellectual kin of global environmental policies that pursue objectives such as decoupling, green growth, and sustainable development. While numerous studies cast doubt on ecological modernization and its associated policy efforts, existing empirical analyses do not fully address the theory's core hypothesis on the relationship between technological innovation and environmental impacts. I resolve this problem by using newly available global patent data on environmental technologies across 35 countries from 1982-2016. Results of panel regression analyses demonstrate that a nation's development of environmental technologies only marginally attenuates the effects of economic activity on a nation's ecological footprint, while the direct effect of patents is to increase, rather than decrease, a nation's ecological footprint. These results offer further evidence of the limits of both (a) ecological modernization theory and (b) environmental policies that exclusively emphasize technological solutions to global environmental problems.","[Bugden, Dylan] Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Bugden, D (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",dylan.bugden@wsu.edu,,,,,,,,7,7,5,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

European cities are particularly important due to their position of power in the global economy as major markets, and places of industrial and social innovation. Yet urban CE policies and discourses remain poorly researched and understood. This paper addresses this research gap by analysing and comparing the CE policies and discourses in different European cities to draw critical insights and recommendations. It does so by first reviewing academic literature on urban CE policies to develop a new conceptual framework to analyse CE discourses and policies. This framework is then used to analyse and compare the CE policies of three European cities: Glasgow, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen. Results show that technocentric approaches to CE are dominant in the three cities. Moreover, they have very limited social justice policies for a fair distribution of the costs and benefits of a CE transition. Key policy recommendations to address these shortcomings are thus proposed. The insights brought about by this paper are valuable for both practitioners and academics seeking to improve urban CE policies.","[Friant, Martin Calisto; Reid, Katie; Boesler, Peppi; Vermeulen, Walter J.

Scaling the political ecologies of the future,POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Imagining progressive environmental futures, especially among critical scholars, can be a fraught enterprise. While some theorists and activists turn towards the social emancipatory power of modem technological interventions at scale, others point to the revolutionary power of degrowth, simplicity, and conviviality. These competing political geographical imaginaries are often strident in their response to one another, though they share core materialist commitments. This essay reviews these contrasting approaches in light of the tradition of political ecology, within the context of an Earth economy that is trending towards higher levels of energy and lower levels of human labor, weighing the degree to which the work and conclusions of political ecologists are congruent with either perspective, neither perspective, or both. The conclusions suggest that, while these two traditions have inverse, or at least orthogonal, views of economic scale, they may not be beyond compromise. Socialist modernism and degrowth sprouted from the same seed, share a political ecological tradition, and may indeed require one another. Eschewing both utopian and dystopian aspirations may open the door to progressive reconciliation and action.","[Robbins, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, 122 Sci Hall,550 North Pk St, Madison, WI 53705 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Robbins, P (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, 122 Sci Hall,550 North Pk St, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",dean@nelson.wisc.edu,,,,,,,,21,21,5,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,POLIT GEOGR,Polit.

This is plainly visible in a number of tools that exist to measure progress towards (or regress from) environmental sustainability. The tools use indices and indicators constructed mostly by environmental scientists and ecologists. As such, they are not neutral scientific instruments: they reflect the worldviews of their creators. These worldviews depend on three dimensions: the values they prioritize, the explanatory theories they use and the futures they envision. Through these means different tools produce conflicting notions of the sustainability of our economies and societies. In this article, we shed light onto the theoretical and epistemological assumptions that lie behind key international sustainability indices and indicators: the Environmental Performance Index, Domestic Material Consumption, Material Intensity, the Material Footprint, the Carbon Footprint, the Ecological Footprint and CO2 emissions (territorial). The variables included in these indices, the way they are measured, aggregated and weighted all imply a particular way of understanding the relationships between economy, society and environment. This divergence is most clearly visible in the fact that some indices are negatively correlated with each other. Where one index might plot growing environmental sustainability, another shows its decline. Our results highlight that those devices and the theories informing them are particularly interesting for way how colonialism is materialized. Some of these measurements hide the material roots of prosperity and the ecological (and economic) distributional conflicts exported to the poorer countries by the global North, and others show how its production and consumption levels are reliant upon a socio-ecological 'subsidy' imposed on Southern countries. These subsidies represent injustices that present a prima facie case for decolonizing indices and indicators of environmental governance.","[Requena-i-Mora, Marina] Jaume I Univ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Requena-i-Mora, Marina] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Brockington, Dan] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Inst Int Dev, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Universitat Jaume I; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield,"Requena-i-Mora, M (corresponding author), Jaume I Univ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.;Requena-i-Mora, M (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",mrequena@uji.es; d.brockington@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,,6,6,0,0,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Some studies argue that information and communications technology's global carbon footprint is set to rise dramatically in the coming years, requiring urgent regulation and sectoral degrowth. Others argue that information and communications technology's growth is largely decoupled from its carbon emissions, and so provides valuable climate solutions and a model for other industries. This article assesses these debates, arguing that, due to data frictions and incommensurate study designs, the question is likely to remain irresolvable at the global scale. We present six methodological factors that drive this impasse: fraught access to industry data, bottom-up vs. top-down assessments, system boundaries, geographic averaging, functional units, and energy efficiencies. In response, we propose an alternative approach that reframes the question in spatial and situated terms: A relational footprinting that demarcates particular relationships between elements-geographic, technical, and social-within broader information and communications technology infrastructures. Illustrating this model with one of the global Internet's most overlooked components-subsea telecommunication cables-we propose that information and communications technology futures would be best charted not only in terms of quantified total energy use, but in specifying the geographical and technical parts of the network that are the least carbon-intensive, and which can therefore provide opportunities for both carbon reductions and a renewed infrastructural politics. In parallel to the politics of (de)growth, we must also consider different network forms.","[Pasek, Anne] Trent Univ, Cultural Studies & Sch Environm, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Vaughan, Hunter] Univ Cambridge, Minderoo Ctr Technol & Democracy, Cambridge, England; [Starosielski, Nicole] NYU, Media Culture & Commun, New York, NY USA",Trent University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Cambridge; New York University,"Pasek, A (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Cultural Studies & Sch Environm, Peterborough, ON, Canada.",annepasek@trentu.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,JAN,2023,10,1,,,,,,,20539517231158992,10.1177/20539517231158994,0,,,14,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,9I4EJ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000939465600001,0,en

However, is giving the Global South a seat at the table truly inclusive development? This article looks at a cross-cultural comparison of the African philosophy of Ubuntu (specifically in South Africa), the Buddhist Gross National Happiness (Bhutan) and the native American idea of Buen Vivir (e.g. Ecuador) and how they view the SDGs, how they view 'development', 'sustainability', goals and indicators, the implicit value underpinnings of the SDGs, prioritization of goals, and missing links, and leadership. Viewed through the lens of the three cosmovisions of the Global, the SDGs do not effectively address the human-nature-well-being interrelationship. Other cosmovisions have an inherent biocentric value orientation that is often ignored in academic and diplomatic circles. These claim to be more promising than continuing green development approaches, based in modernism. On the positive side, the SDGs contain language of all three worldviews. However, the SDGs are not biocentric aiming to respect nature for nature's sake, enabling reciprocity with nature. They embody linear growth/results thinking which requires unlimited resource exploitation, and not cyclical thinking replacing growth with well-being (of all beings). They represent individualism and exclude private sector responsibility. They do not represent collective agency and sharing, implying that there is a need for 'development as service', to one another and to the Earth. Including these perspectives may lead to abolishing the word 'development' within the SDGs, replacing it by inter-relationship; replacing end-result-oriented 'goals' with process thinking; and thinking in cyclical nature, and earth governance, instead of static 'sustainability'. The glass can be viewed as half full or half empty, but the analysis shows that Western 'modernism' is still a strong underpinning of the SDGs. Bridges can be built between Happiness, Ubuntu and Buen Vivir in re-interpreting goal frameworks, global governance and the globalization process. This article is largely based on Van Norren 2017 (Development as service, a Happiness, Ubuntu, and Buen Vivir interdisciplinary view of the Sustainable Development Goals. Doctoral dissertation, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands, 2017).

When energy and material availability change, human societies are enabled to move from strategies that maximize production per unit of time to strategies that optimize efficiency, but the institutional lock-in and cultural frameworks are weakening the reaction capacity of contemporary societies. The growing social mobilization in favor of an ecosocial transition should try to break lock-in, and demand an ecosystem regeneration that makes societies more resilient. In the political debate on the transition, we identify four narratives, labeled as: techno-optimist economism, green capitalism, Green New Deal and degrowth. The article discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the last three positions. The more collapsing positions of degrowth are self-condemning to political marginalization, for absence of an explicit and realistic plan for the transition. On the other hand, a future Green New Deal could serve as an umbrella under which convergences between scientists, workers, activists and politicians could develop, which would mobilize the transformative forces and facilitate the creation of niches or nucleation centers of potentially disruptive practices in a foreseeable future scenario of limited growth. It would also provoke a division in the elites of power, with a part of them seeking an alliance with workers, scientists and activists. These factors, according to Goldstone, favor the success of mobilizations that seek important social changes.","[Garcia-Olivares, Antonio] CSIC, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez, Roger Carles] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Lund University,"Garcia-Olivares, A (corresponding author), CSIC, Madrid, Spain.",agolivares@icm.csic.es; rugi92@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0,0,2,3,"UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",MADRID,"CIUDAD UNIV, OBISPO TREJO 3, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",,,,POLITICA SOC,Politica Soc.,,2021,58,2,,,,,,,e64877,10.5209/poso.64877,0,,,14,Political Science,,Government & Law,UM9TN,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000693666900002,0,en

The academic debate is focused on this polarisation and the possibility that this crisis constitutes an opportunity for change towards a degrowth approach in tourism. However, this approach is not adopted by politicians, entrepreneurs or the media. To confirm this hypothesis, we conducted a study focused on Spain, as it is an important international destination. We have used qualitative analysis tools in order to measure frequencies and construct semantic networks. We have analysed 2,440 written press articles on tourism in Spain, published in newspapers between 1st March and August 31st, 2020.

While the principle of sustainability is increasingly accepted, there are very different concrete declinations of it. I identify two broad interpretations of sustainability and corresponding paths of social change. The dominant approach, promoted by governments, businesses, and international organizations focuses on inclusive green growth. It aims to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation and seeks to make the transition to a green economy as socially inclusive as possible. In this context, enabling social policies mainly focus on employment promotion. The second approach, mostly embraced by heterodox academics and social movements, involves a deeper social-ecological transformation which attempts to lower the priority of economic growth and employment. Accordingly, the role of capacitating welfare states is to enable all individuals to flourish in a post-productivist society. I argue that while the second approach is normatively superior to the first one, it is also more difficult to realize, generating a dilemma for future-oriented politics.","[Laruffa, Francesco] Univ Bremen, Res Ctr Inequal & Social Policy, Bremen, Germany; [Laruffa, Francesco] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany",University of Bremen,"Laruffa, F (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Res Ctr Inequal & Social Policy, Bremen, Germany.;Laruffa, F (corresponding author), Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany.",laruffa@uni-bremen.de,,,Postdoc Mobility Fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); SNSF,Postdoc Mobility Fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work has been supported by the Postdoc Mobility Fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Beyond Inclusion: Rethinking Work and Welfare for a Post-Neoliberal Socio-Ecological Transformation.

Therefore, this paper asks: what strategies can return people to work without returning to the old high-emissions economy? How can we modify the old economic system to reduce environmental impacts while rebuilding employment? Technological change, such as replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy (RE), is necessary but, in an economy that's growing, unlikely to be sufficiently rapid to avoid dangerous climate change. Degrowth in physical consumption, especially by the `rich' 10%, towards a steadystate economy, is needed as well as low-carbon jobs. Technical summary In planning recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments aim to return to economic growth that, by default, is closely coupled to growth in consumption of energy, materials and land, together with growth in population in some countries. This scenario almost certainly forecloses the option of a smooth transition to a climate in which global heating is limited to 1.5 degrees C above the pre-industrial level, the aspirational Paris target. Although the transition to energy efficiency and 100% RE - based mainly on wind, solar and hydro - is now technically feasible, affordable and progressing in some countries, states, cities and businesses, technological transformation would be chasing a retreating goal if economic growth returns. Even to stay below 2 degrees C, reducing consumption, especially by the rich 10%, is needed as well as technology change. Therefore, we explore a pandemic recovery scenario in which low-carbon employment creation is fostered during a process of general degrowth, in biophysical terms, towards an ecologically sustainable steady-state economy. Strategies are suggested for governments to create low-carbon jobs, together with reduced consumption, and to drive and finance the transition. With strong public pressure on governments and business, a 2 degrees C target without overshoot may still be possible. Social media summary Degrowth can be combined with green employment to cut emissions while improving social equity.","[Diesendorf, Mark] UNSW Sydney, Sch Humanities & Languages, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Diesendorf, M (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Humanities & Languages, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.diesendorf@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,,5,5,2,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",,,,GLOB SUSTAIN,Glob.

In addition to the main A, C, and, probably, B defects, the diamonds contain X and Y centers and amber defects of different types and show absorption bands at 1240, 1270, and 1290-1295 cm(-1), peaks in the region 1350-1380 cm(-1), and bands between 3100-3300 cm(-1). Diamonds of different colors contain different associations of structural defects, though they belong to the same variety II according to the Orlov classification. According to the integral spectra of the diamond crystals, the content of structural nitrogen impurity is low, 60-265 ppm. However, spatially resolved spectroscopic examination of diamond plates has revealed highly nonuniform distribution of defects in all diamond crystals. The general regularity for the studied diamonds is a decrease in the total nitrogen content and in the relative fraction of the major A defect from core to periphery of a crystal. The content of structural nitrogen impurity in the core reaches 900 ppm, which is higher than the average N content in widespread octahedral diamond crystals. The presence of C, Y, and X defects in the majority of the samples indicates short postgrowth annealing of these diamonds. The genetic significance of the obtained data on structural defects is discussed. (C) 2015, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS. Published by Elsevier B. V.

While it is often summarized in terms of dichotomous pro and anti-growth positions, several studies indicate that additional views exist, and that these may differ between experts and the general public. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyze segments of the scientific and general population with distinct views in this respect. To this end, we bring together two data sets: one from a nationally representative survey of the general public of Spain (N = 1004) and another from an international survey of researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds (N = 814). Using latent class analysis, we identify three similar segments in the two samples, labeled as Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. Overall, clusters are more consistent, better distinguishable on all constituent dimensions and more polarized in the scientific than public opinion survey. In addition, we find that diverging views on social issues are more strongly associated with distinct clusters in the public opinion sample, and on environmental issues in the scientific opinion sample.","[Drews, Stefan; Savin, Ivan; van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

It is demonstrated that, at a global level, economic growth is strongly correlated with environmental impacts, and barriers to fast decoupling are large and numerous. On the other hand, low or negative growth is highly correlated with increasing unemployment in most market economies, and strategies to change this lead to difficult questions and tradeoffs. The coexistence of these two correlations - which have rarely been studied together in the literature on green growth, degrowth and a-growth - justifies ambivalence about growth. To make key environmental goals compatible with full employment, the decoupling of environmental impacts from economic output has to be accompanied by a reduction of dependence on growth. In particular, strategies to tackle unemployment without the need for growth, several of which are studied in this article, need much more attention in research and policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to that dominant approach, this paper outlines a variety of what the authors call 'low-tech' options - such as solar shower bags, washing lines, alternative heating and cooling methods, and cycling - and raises questions about the extent to which these types of 'simple living' practices could help increase household resilience in conditions of economic disruption, instability, or crisis. The analysis is framed by an 'energy descent' scenario, in which an individual, household or community either chooses a reduced-energy way of life, motivated by climate change mitigation, or has such a way of life imposed upon them due to declining fossil fuel availability or economic disruption. The authors see such a future as plausible - and in some contexts has already arrived or has always been the case - hence the relevance of this analysis, which has both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Furthermore, while the focus herein is on low-tech living at the household level, it is argued that prefiguring a 'simpler way' to live has deeper significance too, in that it could help create the cultural conditions needed for a politics and macroeconomics of degrowth to emerge, which the authors maintain is a necessary part of any decarbonisation project. Challenges facing low-tech options are also acknowledged, including the ever-present risk of rebound effects and other indirect impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The hierarchical structure was fabricated with a crystalline core and an amorphous Mo doped interface. PtRu supported on an IF-MTNPs-C composite (incorporate with carbon black) catalyst was synthesized employing a polyol reduction process. The resultant PtRu/IF-MTNPs-C catalyst exhibits 3.4 times higher mass activity (0.71 A mg(-1) Pt) toward methanol electrooxidation and improved durability (9.3 %) than that of the unmodified PtRu/p-TNPs-C catalyst owing to uniform dispersion and ultrafine-sized PtRu NPs. These favorable features are ascribed to unique merits of IF-MTNPs composite benefiting from modification of Mo at the support interface including the improved electron conductivity and enhanced electron interactions with PtRu NPs based on a strong metal support interaction (SMSI) mechanism.

It does so using an expanded political ecology framework, also drawing upon 'Multi-Level Perspective on Sustainability Transitions' and Gregory Bateson's Ecology of mind. It argues that apparently apolitical focii on lifestyle change and personal development have in some cases given way to overt recognition of the need for global political change. It attributes this to the global political economy of sustainability becoming more evident and critiques of dominant social, political and economic regimes more compelling and widely accepted.","[Henfrey, Thomas] Schumacher Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Henfrey, Thomas] Lisbon Univ, Ce3c, Lisbon, Portugal; [Ford, Lucy] Oxford Brookes Univ, Int Relat, Dept Social Sci, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Universidade de Lisboa; Oxford Brookes University,"Henfrey, T (corresponding author), Schumacher Inst, Bristol, Avon, England.;Henfrey, T (corresponding author), Lisbon Univ, Ce3c, Lisbon, Portugal.",tom@schumacherinstitute.org.uk; lford@brookes.ac.uk,,,Nuffield Foundation,Nuffield Foundation,"Thomas Henfrey thanks Claudian Dobos for a thought-provoking conversation on our return journey from the International Permaculture Convergence in London in September 2015, which helped shape some of the ideas in this article.

The review is the output of an intentional exploration of recent studies in multiple subject areas, based on the authors' decades of work in related fields since the Rio Earth Summit 30 years ago. It documents the failure to progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Consequently, scholarship critiquing the conceptual framework behind those 'Global Goals', and the economic ideology they arose from, is used to explain that failure. Although the pandemic set back the SDGs, it further revealed the inappropriate strategy behind those goals. This suggests the Global Goals constitute an 'own-goal' scored against people and nature. Alternative frameworks for organising action on social and environmental issues are briefly reviewed. It is argued that a future framework must relate to a new eco-social contract between citizen and state and engage existing capabilities that are relevant to an increasingly disrupted world. The case is made for an upgraded form of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) as an overarching framework. The proposed upgrades include detaching from economic ideologies and recognising that a wider metadisaster from climate chaos may reduce the future availability of external support. Therefore, self-reliant resilience and locally led adaptation are important to the future of DRM. Options for professionals continuing to use the term sustainability, such as this journal, are discussed.","[Bendell, Jem] Univ Cumbria, Initiat Leadership & Sustainabil IFLAS, Mason Bldg,Rydal Rd, Ambleside LA22 9BB, Cumbria, England",University of Cumbria,"Bendell, J (corresponding author), Univ Cumbria, Initiat Leadership & Sustainabil IFLAS, Mason Bldg,Rydal Rd, Ambleside LA22 9BB, Cumbria, England.",iflas@cumbria.ac.uk,,,V.

Scholars have identified climate change denial as a factor in thwarting policy responses to climate change. We examine new forms of climate change denial that are critical to recognize as the general public and policy-makers consider actions to limit warming. Here we apply a Marxist conception of ideology to broaden our understanding of climate denialism (Marx & Engels, 1977). We introduce the concept of ideological denialism, which conceals underlying contradictions and perpetuates the current social order. The ideological denial of climate change involves recognizing climate change as a problem, yet fails to diagnose the root causes and prescribes solutions that maintain the current system. We argue that ideological denialism typically stems from a failure to recognize a growth-dependent economic system as a root driver of climate change. We examine degrowth as a possible means to reorganize social relations with potential to more effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming.","[Petersen, Brian] No Arizona Univ, Dept Geog, Planning & Recreat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Stuart, Diana] No Arizona Univ, Sustainable Commun Program, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Gunderson, Ryan] Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, Sociol & Social Justice Studies, Coral Gables, FL USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Petersen, B (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Geog, Planning & Recreat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",brian.petersen@nau.edu,,,,,,,,10,10,6,15,ANU PRESS,ACTON,"RG MENZIES LIBRARY, BLDG 2, AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV, ACTON, ACT 2601 AP, AUSTRALIA",,,,HUM ECOL REV,Hum.

Modern health systems reflect, at every level, the process of `disenchantment' associated with reductive scientific rationality, as well as an ontology of methodological and analytical individualism, which privileges the integrity of the 'body' as opposed to networked 'figurations' of linked individuals within nested ecological systems. Biophysical limits to growth present a systemic challenge to all aspects of modern society, including health systems. Opportunities for an alternative low-throughput' health system would center on reconciling wicked dilemmas of modernity, including (1) the increasing vulnerability of high-overhead, materially and energetically intensive global healthcare systems funded through the welfare state in a future defined by ecological limits to economic growth, and (2) the diminishing returns of a curative health system that treats individual human bodies while incurring negative health outcomes at the level of society and ecology.","[Zywert, Katharine; Quilley, Stephen] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, Fac Environm, Environm 2 EV2, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Zywert, K (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, Fac Environm, Environm 2 EV2, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",kzywert@uwaterloo.ca; squilley@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,,4,4,0,7,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",,,,SOC THEOR HEALTH,Soc.

Some studies conceptualize these movements as ideologically mature and coherent, while other inquiries highlight disorganization, fragmentation, disillusion, and dispute. The former line of argument suggests that underlying emerging global solidaritiesto the extent they genuinely existthere are some identifiably coherent cosmopolitanist, or globalist, values. The latter claim that existing global justice and transformative movements lack an effective ideological position for uniting the masses behind a global (political) project for transforming global capitalist social relations. By drawing upon an interpretive review of empirical studies conducted throughout the last decade, the article delineates four modalities, defined in terms of their orientations toward cosmopolitanist values. Among these modalities is a new and promising one, termed here as transversal cosmopolitanist' (transversal' here understood as a process verb, indicating a new form of cosmopolitanist praxis). This approach assumes the possibility of creating a common ground for fruitful dialogue, constructive collective learning, progressive hybridization, and active political cooperation among diverse identities and ideological visions of contemporary global transformative movements, against existing capitalist social relations and structures of domination.","[Hosseini, S.

Here the site-controlled growth of aligned CdS-CdSe core-shell nanowalls is reported by a combination of surface-guided vaporliquid-solid horizontal growth and selective-area vapor-solid epitaxial growth, and their integration into photodetectors at wafer-scale without postgrowth transfer, alignment, or selective shell-etching steps. The photocurrent response of these nanowalls is reduced to 200 ns with a gain of up to 3.8 x 10(3) and a photoresponsivity of 1.2 x 10(3) A W-1, the fastest response at such a high gain ever reported for photodetectors based on compound semiconductor nanostructures. The simultaneous achievement of sub-microsecond response and high-gain photocurrent is attributed to the virtues of both the epitaxial CdS-CdSe heterojunction and the enhanced charge-separation efficiency of the core-shell nanowall geometry.

However, the potential for substitution has become particularly important in the COVID-19 pandemic context which has significantly impacted travel flows as well as the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Drawing upon data on major tourism destinations and generating markets, a tourism policy thought experiment is conducted to explore the substitutability of domestic for international tourism in selected countries in light of COVID-19 and other situations, such as the climate crisis and the urgent need for low carbon tourism. The analysis and discussion highlight the complexities in achieving sustainable substitution in rescaling international mobilities to domestic. It is argued that without careful changes to overall tourism provision and consumption behaviours in the international-domestic tourism division, a (partial) shift may provide short gains but is likely to fail in the long term. The paper concludes with a critical analysis of contemporary debates on COVID-19 related tourism transformation in relation to substitution between domestic and international tourism and sustainable tourism futures.","[Seyfi, Siamak; Hall, C.

The crisis is often described in relation to its proximal risk factors such as the proliferation of risky loans and mortgage-based securities, but the root causes of the Great Recession include distal risk factors such as indiscriminate capital flow, excessive financial deregulation, and high concentration of wealth in the top distribution. Ultimately, the crisis is a byproduct of neoliberal policies and the 'self-correcting market' ideology that guided national and global macroeconomic reforms since the 1970s. Evidence indicates that the Great Recession led to increases in unemployment and suicides, especially in Europe and in the US. Estimates based on the effects of previous economic downturns suggest that the crisis produced negative health and nutritional outcomes in developing countries. Data, however, also show that recessions can be characterized by increases in life expectancy at birth. These favorable trends seem associated with policy regimes favoring a more egalitarian distribution of income and stronger social protections that can decouple the link between unemployment and suicides during crises ('healthy de-growth'.). New rules and regulations at the national and global level are needed to prevent future financial crises. The crisis also provides an opportunity to challenge neoliberalism, the ideology of the 'self-correcting market' and envision a new model of economic development where GDP growth is longer the main national policy priority. Governments can achieve a regime of 'healthy de-growth' if they step in with appropriate policy interventions toward a more egalitarian distribution of income and stronger social protections.","[De Vogli, Roberto] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Owusu, Jocelynn T.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav & Hlth Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"De Vogli, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",r.devogli@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,,14,14,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CRIT PUBLIC HEALTH,Crit.

McCloskey's (2015) critique regarding the failure of the MDGs, as a direct result of a lack of critical consciousness, and understanding of the structural contexts of poverty and under-development, provided the impetus for our work. McCloskey (2015) signals the important role of education in fostering transitions to sustainability. As such, we have applied our critical lens to the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our paper offers tools for critically thinking through the potential for the SDGs to help shape the tourism industry for more sustainable, equitable, and just futures. We positioned six themes to serve as a conceptual framework for interrogating the SDG agenda in tourism; arising from our considerations of both reformist and radical pathways to sustainable transitions in tourism: critical tourism scholarship, gender in the sustainable development agenda, engaging with Indigenous perspectives and other paradigms, degrowth and the circular economy, governance and planning, and ethical consumption. We address these core themes as essential platforms to critique the SDGs in the context of sustainable tourism development, and highlight the cutting edge research carried out by our contributors in this special issue.","[Boluk, Karla A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Recreat & Leisure Studies, Fac Appl Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Cavaliere, Christina T.] Stockton Univ, Hospitality & Tourism Management Studies, Galloway, NJ USA; [Higgins-Desbiolles, Freya] Univ South Australia, Sch Management Teaching, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Waterloo; Stockton University; University of South Australia,"Boluk, KA (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Recreat & Leisure Studies, Fac Appl Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",kboluk@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,,131,131,12,89,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

To this end, the article analyzes the issues of sustainable development in the three main strands of international economic law (trade, investment, and finance) at national and transnational levels. The analysis reveals a policy interdependence between international economic law and sustainable development. The latter hence represents a specific regulatory construct that aims at compensating the losses of exhaustible resources with investments in technology and knowledge. This, however, merely justifies and legitimizes the over-exploitation of certain parts of the globe, including not only their natural resources, but also human and other capitals. To overcome these unsustainable models, the article proposes a paradigm shift away from the standard of sustainable development in international economic law, towards one of sustainability. The idea is to replace sustainable development with sustainable economy. Law can act as a trigger of such a shift through ensuring trust and cooperation between public institutions, private companies, civil society, local communities, and individual citizens.","[Aseeva, Anna] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Fac Law, Sch Gen & Interdisciplinary Legal Studies, 3 Bolshoi Trexsviatitelskiy Str, Moscow 109240, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Aseeva, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Fac Law, Sch Gen & Interdisciplinary Legal Studies, 3 Bolshoi Trexsviatitelskiy Str, Moscow 109240, Russia.",anna.aseeva@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,,10,10,1,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,4022,10.3390/su10114022,0,,,30,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC1AQ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000451531700196,0,en

Framed as a technologically driven and economically profitable vision of continued growth in a resource-scarce world, the CE has of late been taken up by the European Commission and global business leaders alike. However, within CE debates and documentation, little is said about the social and political implications of such transformative agendas. Whilst CE proponents claim their agenda is 'radical', this paper outlines its inability to address many deeply embedded challenges around issues of consumption and the consumer, echoing as it does the problematic (and arguably failed) agendas of sustainable consumption/lifestyles. Using the Sharing Economy as an example, we argue here that the ontological and sociological assumptions of the CE must be open to more 'radical' critique and reconsideration if this agenda is to deliver the profound transformations that its advocates claim are within our collective reach.

This first aim is addressed based on ongoing research on '3-D Sustainability', a concept providing decision-making support for priority setting between environmental, social and economic dimensions within sustainable development. The two main objectives identified within this aim are to stay by means of international environmental law within the ecologically sustainable scale and to legally define flexible trade-off mechanisms, which better deal with conflicts of interests among the three sustainability dimensions. Secondly, the paper strives to identify ways to further strengthen the application of the existing international law in this respect. Thus, several innovative mechanisms within international law are identified that overcome current implementation and enforcement deadlocks, without necessarily changing the existing law, in order to serve a sustainable development in the sense of Ecological Economics.","[Mauerhofer, Volker] Meiji Univ, Org Strateg Coordinat Environm Res, Environm Law Ctr, Tokyo, Japan",Meiji University,"Mauerhofer, V (corresponding author), Meiji Univ, Org Strateg Coordinat Environm Res, Environm Law Ctr, Tokyo, Japan.",volker.mauerhofer@gmx.at,,,,,,,,12,12,2,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The first is the sheer magnitude of the global predicament, which determines not just the insufficiently recognized difficulty of the transition task but also that the goals and means must take particular and largely unrecognized forms. The goal cannot be reform of the existing society; it must be transition to a radically different kind of society, one labeled here as a radically Simpler Way. Current discussion indicates little recognition of this point. Similarly there are coercive logical implications for transition strategy, and these indicate that currently dominant transition assumptions are mistaken. The key element is not economic or political change, it is cultural change. These claims are shown to be logically implied by basic limits to growth considerations.","[Trainer, Ted] 5 Dryandra St, Wadalba 2259, Australia",,"Trainer, T (corresponding author), 5 Dryandra St, Wadalba 2259, Australia.",,,,,,,,,14,14,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The policy brief explores the pandemic through the lens of the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions. The pandemic is framed as a meta-transition event at the landscape level of unprecedented scale, pace, and pervasiveness such that it permeates all socio-technical regimes simultaneously. The prospects for the future are then defined on a matrix that compares the strength of civil society and that of economic structures. The result is four distinct scenarios that are linked to contemporary discourses on socio-economic futures: business as usual; managed transition; chaotic transition; and managed degrowth. The scenarios are presented as a starting point for policy discussion and the engagement of societal actors to define social and economic possibilities for the future, and the implications that the different futures would have for ecological burdens. It is concluded that the COVID 19 pandemic can act as a catalytic event in which the legitimacy and efficacy of existing economic and political structures will be challenged and reshaped, and hence is an opportunity to redefine the ecological burdens our activities create.","[Wells, Peter; Abouarghoub, Wessam; Pettit, Stephen; Beresford, Anthony] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales",Cardiff University,"Wells, P (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales.",wellspe@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,,31,32,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-SCI P,Sustainability-Sci.

Prior, cross-sectional work shows that larger households tend to have lower per capita carbon footprints and energy use due to sharing of living space and resources. However, we lack longitudinal studies that examine whether dwindling household sizes globally increase carbon footprints and create additional pressure for mitigation efforts in the future. We use data from 43 countries between 1995 and 2015, representative of 63% of the population and 80% of the carbon footprint globally in 2015. If household sizes had stayed at their 1995-levels, cumulative emissions between 1995 and 2015 would have been about 11.3 GtCO2eq lower. We project per capita total carbon footprints for 2030, showing that more household sharing could make a contribution to curbing emissions. This contribution, along other sustainable degrowth interventions, can produce substantial emission reductions necessary for achieving 1.5 degrees C compatible reduction targets for 2030. We further quantify some of the key socio-economic influences behind the household dynamics to discuss policy options for increased inter-and intra-household sharing.","[Ivanova, Diana; Buechs, Milena] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, England",N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds,"Buechs, M (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, England.",d.ivanova@leeds.ac.uk; M.M.Buchs@leeds.ac.uk,,,"European Union [840454]; UK Research and Innovation, Centre for Research on Energy Demand Solutions [EPSRC] [EP/R035288/1]","European Union(European Commission); UK Research and Innovation, Centre for Research on Energy Demand Solutions [EPSRC]","Funding The European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation pro-gram funded the research under Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agree-ment 840454.

In this Discussion article, we examine the amount of natural resources that is increasingly being consumed and wasted by humanity, and propose solutions to reverse this pattern. Since the beginning of the 20th century, societies, especially from industrialized countries, have been wasting resources in different ways. On one hand, the metabolism of industrial societies relies on non-renewable resources. On the other hand, yearly, we directly waste or mismanage around 78% of the total water withdrawn, 49% of the food produced, 31% of the energy produced, 85% of ores and 26% of non-metallic minerals extracted, respectively. As a consequence, natural resources are getting depleted and ecosystems polluted, leading to irreversible environmental changes, biological loss and social conflicts. To reduce the anthropogenic footprint in the planet, and live in harmony with other species and ourselves, we suggest to shift the current economic model based on infinite growth and reduce inequality between and within countries, following a degrowth strategy in industrialized countries. Public education to reduce superfluous consumption is also necessary. In addition, we propose a set of technological strategies to improve the management of natural resources towards circular economies that, like ecosystems, rely only upon renewable resources.

We draw on the works of political philosophers Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe and Judith Butler to develop a typology of transformational dynamics. In this typology, the word transformation implies political agendas, processes and outcomes that involve the total structural reordering of a social field, which we juxtapose with 'inclusion', which implies cases in which pre-existing logics are further entrenched or extended. Drawing on the theoretical framework of hegemony, inclusions and transformations, we develop an analytical lens that focuses on the relations between hegemony and transformative dynamics. This analytical lens is developed and exemplified by discussing the transformative potentials of multiple socioecological and political agendas, including those associated with eco-modernism, Marxism, decoloniality, eco-feminism, degrowth and eco-anarchism. Depending on the transformative dynamics in relation to hegemony and the dominant political logics, we distinguish between hegemony-reinforcing, hegemony-replacing, and hegemony-transcending transformations. The provided lens and the typologies of transformations should be useful to those seeking to conceptualize, differentiate, analyse, and tactically strategize the realization of an array of socio-ecological agendas.","[Hamilton, Rachel Tome Valencia; Ramcilovic-Suominen, Sabaheta] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luonnonvarakeskus, Helsinki, Finland",,"Ramcilovic-Suominen, S (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luonnonvarakeskus, Helsinki, Finland.",sabaheta.ramcilovik-suominen@luke.fi,,,Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Academy of Finland [332353],Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),Open access funding provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

Three scenarios have been developed with different assumptions regarding national and global oil availability under a Business-As-Usual narrative. Energy demand would have a 2.4-fold increase by 2050 with predominance of petroleum products in a BAU scenario with unlimited oil access. In constrained scenarios, restricted availability of oil might pressure final demand to be reduced in 31%-40% compared to BAU. Limited imports of oil and petroleum products might produce shortages in supply, causing a downfall in economic activity in sectors with high dependency on these fuels Electricity would partially substitute fossil fuels but is not enough to offset economy decay in constrained scenarios. Limiting oil exports would not have an important effect since the decline of Ecuador's oil wells is expected to be too fast. Oil exports would cease by 2030-2045. When BAU scenarios are evaluated considering limited fossil energy access in a decaying world oil production, arise the necessity to explore new strategies to deal with an energy/economic shock.","[Espinoza, Vicente Sebastian; Fontalvo, Javier] Inst Invest Geol & Energet IIGE, Quito, Ecuador; [Marti-Herrero, Jaime] Univ Reg Amazon Ikiam, Biomass Resources Grp, Via Tena Muyuna,Km 7, Tena, Napo, Ecuador; [Marti-Herrero, Jaime] Ctr Int Metodes Numer Engn CIMNE, Bldg Energy & Environm Grp, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Espinoza, Vicente Sebastian; Miguel, Luis Javier; Mediavilla, Margarita] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Espinoza, Vicente Sebastian] Ave Republ E7-263 & Diego de Almagro,Edificio Sky, Quito 170518, Ecuador",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Centre Internacional de Metodes Numerics en Enginyeria (CIMNE); Universidad de Valladolid,"Espinoza, VS (corresponding author), Inst Invest Geol & Energet IIGE, Quito, Ecuador.;Espinoza, VS (corresponding author), Ave Republ E7-263 & Diego de Almagro,Edificio Sky, Quito 170518, Ecuador.",sebastian.espinoza@geoenergia.gob.ec,,,"Research Group on Energy, Economy and System Dynamics of the University of Valladolid","Research Group on Energy, Economy and System Dynamics of the University of Valladolid","Gratitude is expressed to the Research Group on Energy, Economy and System Dynamics of the University of Valladolid for the support in the development of the present work.",,,3,3,6,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,,,ENERGY,Energy,NOV 15,2022,259,,,,,,,,124963,10.1016/j.energy.2022.124963,0,,AUG 2022,18,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels,,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels,5N5EF,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000871811900002,0,en

Packaging waste is now considered one of the world?s most urgent environmental problems. Most responses to the problem have focused on recycling or the introduction of biomass-based materials. Whilst useful, these approaches focus on managing the symptoms and do not address why the food system has become reliant on single-use packaging. In this paper we use systems method to understand the drivers for the food packaging problem. We apply the first two steps of the systems method to develop a Causal Loop Diagram representing variables and feedback loops that influence the use of food packaging. The modelling process has been supported by a narrative literature review and by the analysis of the behaviour over time. The results show that there are three main interlinked subsystems that drive food packaging use: the globalisation, the expansion of supermarkets and the constraints on households? time. In order to reduce food packaging, structural changes are required. Shifting away from a growth-driven food economy towards a degrowth economic model may reduce the need for food packaging. Redesigning and decentralising food systems are just some of the potential solutions.","[Chakori, Sabrina; Aziz, Ammar Abdul] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Smith, Carl] Univ Queensland, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dargusch, Paul] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Chakori, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",sabrina.chakori@uq.net.au,,,Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","We acknowledge the financial support provided by Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

In response to ensuing public outcries, governmental agencies, and researchers across the globe began mobilizing around alternative biofuel feedstock. Among these materials, algae emerged as the most hopeful sustainable alternative in producing biofuels. This article examines algal biofuel production systems designed offshore and integrated with wastewater treatment and carbon dioxide absorption processes to revitalize faith in biofuels in the blue economy. It discusses what makes algal biofuels sustainable by examining the ways practitioners talk about and design these integrated systems. Against the common refrain that algae's photosynthetic and reproductive capacity makes these systems sustainable, this article underlines that there is nothing natural, innate, about algae to add to sustainable blue economies. Rather, algae become naturalized as biofuel source and bioremediation technologies through technoscientific discourses and interventions, which embed and reproduce anthropocentric approach to sustainability that centers on the ideology of growth. By drawing particular attention to the ways that integrated algal biofuel production systems depend on the constant generation of industrial waste, this article problematizes anthropocentric sustainability imaginaries and claims for imagining sustainability otherwise through the lens of blue degrowth to create a radical socio-ecological change.","[Kasdogan, Duygu] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Balatcik Mahallesi Havaalani Sosesi 33-2 Balatcik, TR-35620 Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Katip Celebi University,"Kasdogan, D (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Balatcik Mahallesi Havaalani Sosesi 33-2 Balatcik, TR-35620 Izmir, Turkey.",duygu.kasdogan@ikcu.edu.tr,,,,,,,,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

J,"Tukker, A",,,,"Tukker, Arnold",,,Knowledge collaboration and learning by aligning global sustainability programs: reflections in the context of Rio+20,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Green economy; Sustainability; Sustainable consumption and production,CONSUMPTION,"There is widespread concern that the 'economy is crashing against the Earth', already causing problems in terms of climate change, water depletion and loss of biodiversity. Yet, the global economy still will have to grow two- to four-fold to provide all future global inhabitants with the average yearly income of $10,000 that is needed to have a reasonable life expectancy and human development index. Rio+20 was intended to reconcile the need for poverty eradication with a green economy, but had limited perceived success. This paper analyses how some of the major international sustainability programs that contributed to Rio+20 could have supported a more far-reaching outcome. Two problems are identified: the programs showed significant overlap, and the programs themselves were often incremental in nature, seeking compromises and avoiding more radical approaches such as the 'degrowth agenda'. To address the first problem, we suggest how a natural process of mutual collaboration, learning and strengthening could occur: the UN Green Economy Initiative could focus on providing the socio-economic rationale for sustainability; bodies like the IPCC and the UNEP Resources Panel could focus on providing the environmental rationale and planetary limits related to sustainability; programs in the field of sustainable consumption and production as well as resource-efficient and cleaner production could focus on providing hands-on support and proof of how to change direction. There seems no clear-cut answer for the second problem. Some authors suggest relying more on action outside formal policy systems that, by nature, seek compromises. However, they also see a required role for government action, which is exactly what Rio+20 and its supportive policy programs failed to achieve and negotiate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond the formidable human cost of maintaining a divided world, the possibility of incomplete globalisation also gives rise to a number of environmental risks. While environmental political theory generally sees strength in localism, history rather shows that a robust world trade system is crucial to offset local resource scarcities and that cosmopolitan norms of solidarity are essential for helping communities to rebuild after environmental catastrophe. In relation to climate change, statist thinking has led to a focus on non-scalable technologies and a silent acceptance of chronic poverty abroad as a way of avoiding a climate emergency. Contrary to such views, this paper argues that accelerating the transition to a fully integrated high-energy planet may more effectively mitigate Anthropocene risks.","[Karlsson, Rasmus] Umea Univ, Polit Sci, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Karlsson, R (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",rasmus.karlsson@umu.se,,,Karl Staaf Foundation,Karl Staaf Foundation,"The author would also like to thank the Karl Staaf Foundation for a travel grant which made it possible to present his research at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association in Atlanta, 16-19 March 2016.",,,7,7,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,,2017,14,4,,,,,550,562,,10.1080/14747731.2016.1216820,0,,,13,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EO8OV,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000396950000005,0,en

We studied the optical properties of various CdSe core-only and core/shell NCs integrated in ZnSe epitaxial-chemical hybrid structures. Depending on the type and environment of the NCs, a blueshift of the photoluminescence energy and a strong reduction of the emission intensity are observed after overgrowth. We demonstrate that these effects are caused by a potential barrier at the interface between NCs and ZnSe. The application of an appropriate postgrowth laser annealing procedure removes this potential barrier and enhances charge transfer from the ZnSe into the NCs. Consequently, we observe a significant increase of the emission intensity and a redshift of the photoluminescence energy of the NCs after annealing. Three-dimensional quantum-mechanical model calculations of the band diagram of the NCs as synthesized in solution, after overgrowth with ZnSe and after laser annealing confirm the presence of this potential barrier and its reduction due to the annealing.","[Kampmeier, J.; Ruth, M.; Meier, C.; Schikora, D.; Lischka, K.; Pawlis, A.] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Phys, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Rashad, M.] Univ Assiut, Dept Phys, Assiut 71516, Egypt; [Woggon, U.] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Opt & Atom Phys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",University of Paderborn; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Assiut University; Technical University of Berlin,"Kampmeier, J (corresponding author), Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Phys, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",apawlis@mail.upb.de,,,"DFG-Graduiertenkolleg [GRK-1464]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Funding Program for World-leading Innovative Research and development on Science and Technology (FIRST)","DFG-Graduiertenkolleg(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Funding Program for World-leading Innovative Research and development on Science and Technology (FIRST)","We acknowledge the financial support for this research work by the DFG-Graduiertenkolleg GRK-1464, by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and through the Funding Program for World-leading Innovative Research and development on Science and Technology (FIRST).",,,8,8,0,10,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",,,,PHYS REV B,Phys.

In order to understand this evolution, we develop a model describing the dynamics of four distinct opinions as identified in recent surveys, namely growthat-all-cost, green growth, agrowth and degrowth. The model is based on modifying standard replicator dynamics to match a multi-group structure. Individuals are influenced by local or global interactions with others, based on adjacent opinion groups and exposure to information about environmental change. Psychological resistance to opinion change is also accounted for. The model is calibrated with recent survey data. Numerical analysis shows which opinions survive under particular conditions. We find, among others, that under local interactions, ultimate outcomes are characterized by lack of consensus, i.e. survival of multiple opinions. In addition, equal impacts of environmental change on opinions do not always translate in joint survival of associated opinions. Under worsening environmental conditions while continuing economic growth, opinions shift from green growth to agrowth and degrowth. Fostering global interactions among individuals, causing them to be influenced by a broad spectrum of opinions, makes consensus more likely. We also consider model dynamics if feedback from opinions to policy to environmental change and back is included. This confirms robustness of the results. It should be noted that the model is not meant to predict but to explore the consequences of combinations of assumptions about social networks, psychological mechanisms, environmental dynamics, and connections between opinion distribution and environmental policy. The study represents the first analysis of opinion dynamics in the growth-vs-environment debate and suggests a number of routes for further investigation.","[van den Bergh, Jeroen C. J.

As motivation, we first present evidence suggesting more neoliberal countries perform worse in addressing climate change. We then analyze how three tenets of neoliberal ideology-to decentralize democracy, defund public investment, and deregulate the economy-have stymied climate action in the United States.

New thinking around ecosocialism, degrowth, happiness and the wellbeing economy insist on keeping alive the utopian imagination. It seeks to break through the constraints of traditional state-or-market development debates, by searching for ways to subordinate both the state and market to society, in harmony with non-human nature. Pioneering work on alternative development indicators has been done in recent times, the most notable being the Gross National Happiness Index, currently in practice within the small Buddhist mountain state of Bhutan. The happiness/wellbeing perspectives do not have an explicit critique of capitalism, and avoid any mention of 'socialism' or 'ecosocialism'.

Both emphasized the dangers of economic growth, and both drew negative reactions from mainstream economists. Relying on archival evidence, we show that Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome developed strategies of mutual support, which would present them at first view as natural allies. Georgescu-Roegen actually became a member of the Club of Rome, while Dennis Meadows acknowledged the influence of Georgescu-Roegen's ideas on the team of authors of Limits to Growth. But in the late 70's, the gap widened between Georgescu-Roegen's adamant defense of de-growth, and the Club of Rome's less firm view of sustainable growth. This paper explores the process leading to the self-isolation of Georgescu-Roegen, by showing that beyond a shared acknowledgment that economic and biologic systems were interdependent, technological optimism and ambitions for the global management of growth were central to the Club of Rome, while Georgescu-Roegen's personal history led him to ignore those practicalities and judge that de-growth was inescapable.

Doping optimization focused on both bulk doping concentrations and mitigating the transient incorporation effects that otherwise causes nonabrupt doping profiles in the Te doped layer. These efforts resulted in a fully relaxed metamorphic tunnel diode at the target lattice constant having a peak tunneling current density (J(P)) of 279.1 A center dot cm(-2) and a zero-bias resistance-area product (RA) of 3.0 x 10(-4) ohm center dot cm(2). After postgrowth annealing to emulate the thermal load of the GaAs0.75P0.25 top cell growth and elimination of the performance-enhancing carbon activation anneal, the device achieved J(P) = 13.1 A center dot cm(-2) and RA = 1.5 x 10(-3) ohm center dot cm(2). These worst-case values are very promising as they enable the operation of GaAs0.75P0.25/Si tandems under one-sun AM1.5G illumination with negligible series resistance and at AM1.5D concentrations up to 240 suns with only 0.1% absolute efficiency loss.","[Chmielewski, Daniel J.; Lepkowski, Daniel L.; Boyer, Jacob T.; Grassman, Tyler J.; Ringel, Steven A.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Ringel, SA (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",chmielewski.20@osu.edu; lepkowski.3@osu.edu; boyer.296@osu.edu; grassman.5@osu.edu; Ringel.5@osu.edu,,,"Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [DE-EE0007539]","Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by the Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under Award DE-EE0007539 (Daniel J.

This can only be done if there is a de-growth transition to some kind of Simpler Way centered on mostly small, highly self-sufficient and self-governing communities in control of local economies within a culture that is not focused on material wealth. It is not surprising that the viability of such a vision is typically regarded as implausible. The aim of this study is to show that normal outer city suburbs could be restructured along the lines required to cut global impacts by the necessary amount, while improving the quality of life. Data on typical Australian consumption rates, food production yields, suburban geographies, etc. is used to estimate the achievable reductions. The theoretical conclusion that such reductions could be made aligns with a study of the Dancing Rabbit Eco-village in northeast Missouri.

Drawing on an argument made by David Graeber, it is suggested that modern European history can be interpreted as a process of the 'generalization of avoidance', in which such abstract, property-based forms of personhood, which were initially what defined the superior party in relations of hierarchy, came to be a model for the figures of market participant and citizen within the spheres of formal equal exchange of economy and politics. From this perspective, and building on an account of different stages of capitalist history as 'subjectivation regimes', the article then analyses the transition from the 'exclusive democracy' of post-war organized capitalism in Western Europe, in which citizens' entitlement, through the collective guarantees of 'social property' (Castel), increasingly allowed individualized competitive practices of status attainment and gave rise to individualist movements for extended citizenship, to current-day flexible capitalism. This regime, seizing on those calls and instrumentalizing the desires for competitive status consumption, has effected a broad restructuring of the social as a unified field of competition in which new hierarchies and inequalities materialize in global chains of appropriation, causing a 'dividual' fragmentation of property-based personhood and generating calls for responsible citizenship as an inherent counter-movement. In conclusion, it is suggested that anthropologists have much to contribute to investigating the possibility of democratic, post-capitalist 'anthropologies of degrowth'.","[Eversberg, Dennis] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Sociol, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Eversberg, D (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Sociol, BMBF Jr Res Grp Mental Flux Flumen, Humboldtstr 34, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",dennis.eversberg@uni-jena.de,,,German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author acknowledges support for the publication of this article from the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the work of the Junior Research Group 'Mentalities in Flux' (flumen) within the funding line 'Bioeconomy as societal change'.",,,3,3,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,ANTHROPOL THEOR,Anthropol.

I argue that the most effective response is to exit rather than attempt to overthrow capitalism and the hierarchical state by international revolution. Socialists in positions of authority in state institutions and capitalist enterprises can facilitate this process by enacting legislation that helps people to transition to new smaller-scale non-statist social units, such as producer-consumer co-operatives producing their own food and other essential services over time.

Herein, a computational and experimental study of complex F-type defect centers formed in YAG by doping with cerium and carbon is addressed. The formation energies determined by ab initio calculations of different defects and atomic chemical potentials in YAG:Ce,C are discussed in O-poor and O-rich conditions corresponding to the crystal growth under Ar+CO reducing atmosphere, and postgrowth annealing in air, respectively. It is shown that as-grown crystals contain numerous positively charged defects responsible for F-type center formation, whereas mainly negative-charged defects are remained after the annealing in air. The negatively charged defects located nearby Ce luminescence center occupying Y site may stabilize cerium in the tetravalent state and promote a hole transport to this luminescence center. This describes a high scintillation efficiency of Ce,C-doped garnets. Furthermore, YAG:C and YAG:Ce,C with a high carbon concentration, in addition to luminescence peaked at 400 ns ascribed to F+-type centers, possess a fast luminescence peaked around 650 nm that may be attributed to the complex defect centers. These unveiled features of the luminescence process in rare-earth garnets may contribute to the development of efficient luminescence materials.","[Jia, Lingchun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Informat Technol, Huchenghuan Rd 999, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiajie] Tongji Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Engn, Siping Rd 1239, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Boyaryntseva, Yanina; Gerasymov, Iaroslav; Grynyov, Borys; Sidletskiy, Oleg] Inst Scintillat Mat NAS Ukraine, Dept Crystal Growth Technol, 60 Nauky Ave, UA-61072 Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Sidletskiy, Oleg] Kazimierz Wielki Univ Bydgoszcz, Inst Phys, Powstancow Wielkopolskich Str 2, PL-85090 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Sidletskiy, Oleg] Ctr Excellence ENSEMBLE3 Sp Zoo, Oxide Crystals Grp, Ul Wolczynska 133, PL-01919 Warsaw, Poland",Shanghai Ocean University; Tongji University; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Kazimierz Wielki University,"Sidletskiy, O (corresponding author), Inst Scintillat Mat NAS Ukraine, Dept Crystal Growth Technol, 60 Nauky Ave, UA-61072 Kharkiv, Ukraine.;Sidletskiy, O (corresponding author), Kazimierz Wielki Univ Bydgoszcz, Inst Phys, Powstancow Wielkopolskich Str 2, PL-85090 Bydgoszcz, Poland.;Sidletskiy, O (corresponding author), Ctr Excellence ENSEMBLE3 Sp Zoo, Oxide Crystals Grp, Ul Wolczynska 133, PL-01919 Warsaw, Poland.",sidletskiy@isma.kharkov.ua,,,"Ukrainian side by the Carbon project of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine [0119U100791]; Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange [PPN/ULM/2020/1/00298/U/00001]; ENSEMBLE3 - Centre of Excellence for nanophotonics, advanced materials and novel crystal growth-based technologies project [MAB/2020/14]; European Union; European Union [857543]","Ukrainian side by the Carbon project of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine; Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange(Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA)); ENSEMBLE3 - Centre of Excellence for nanophotonics, advanced materials and novel crystal growth-based technologies project; European Union(European Commission); European Union(European Commission)","The work was supported from the Ukrainian side by the Carbon project of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Reg.

Ecovillages are inherently speculative ventures, or as Burke and Arjona (2013) note, laboratories for alternative political ecologies, inviting-and indeed, necessitating-the reimagination of human lives with greater consideration for the natural world. In this sense, such communities might be understood as exilic spaces (O'Hearn and Grubacic 2016), in that they seek to build autonomous and self-sustaining agricultural, social, and economic systems while also reflecting a stance of resistance to neoliberal capitalist structures. At the same time, communities may also remain dependent on connections to broader regional or global markets in diverse and interconnected ways. Understanding ecovillages as diverse and emergent worldings (de la Cadena and Blaser 2018), I ask how these experimental social ventures reckon with their connections to the very systems they are positioned against. To trace out how communities negotiate this fragile space, this article is concerned with how ecovillagers spend their time at work-particularly when it comes to managing relationships with and between more-than-human beings. Drawing on participant observation with ecovillagers and more-than-human others they work with, I explore how the concept of rentabilidad (profitability) is differently constructed. To this end, I highlight ethnographic examples where rentabilidad is purposefully reconceptualized with more-than-human lives in mind; such a shift, I suggest, hinges on ecovillagers' individualized relations with the beings they (imagine themselves) to care for.","[Morris, Olea] Cent European Univ, Quellenstr 51-55, A-1100 Vienna, Austria",,"Morris, O (corresponding author), Cent European Univ, Quellenstr 51-55, A-1100 Vienna, Austria.",morris_olea@phd.ceu.edu,,,Central European University; Central European University Private University,Central European University; Central European University Private University,Open access funding provided by Central European University Private University.

By a gradual transformation of its grounds, infrastructure, and social fabric, the long-term goal of the DDRC is to function as a tangible model that can be experienced and replicated as a whole or in parts in the city or elsewhere. The paper discusses the goals, methodologies and strategies introduced during the project aiming towards the regenerative transformation of the institution that drew inspiration from permaculture principles, nature-based solutions and a net-positive design perspective.

Engineering misfit-guided QD growth on a nanoscale substrate such as the small curvature surface of a nanowire represents a new approach to self-organized nanostructure preparation. Perhaps more profoundly, the periodic stress underlying each QD and the resulting modulation of electro-optical properties inside the nanowire backbone promise to provide a new platform for novel mechano-electronic, thermoelectronic, and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we report a first experimental demonstration of self-organized and self-limited growth of coherent, periodic Ge QDs on a one-dimensional Si nanowire substrate. Systematic characterizations reveal several distinctively different modes of Ge QD ordering on the Si nanowire substrate depending on the core diameter. In particular, Ge QD arrays on Si nanowires of around 20 nm diameter predominantly exhibit an anticorrelated pattern whose wavelength agrees with theoretical predictions. The correlated pattern can be attributed to propagation and correlation of misfit strain across the diameter of the thin nanowire substrate. The QD array growth is self-limited as the wavelength of the QDs remains unchanged even, after prolonged Ge deposition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct kinetic transformation from a uniform Ge shell layer to discrete QD arrays by a postgrowth annealing process.","[Kwon, Soonshin; Xiang, Jie] Univ Calif San Diego, Mat Sci & Engn Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chen, Zack C.

In this study, it is instead argued that the spread of green products through economic complexity and international trade are possible means of solving this problem. To this end, the individual and interactive environmental impacts of economic complexity and international green trade are examined in a panel of 24 European Union nations between 2000 and 2018. Panel quantile regressions (QRs) and Driscoll-Kraay fixed effect-OLS regressions are employed in analysing the relationships. The findings reveal that both green trade and economic complexity have beneficial individual effects on the environment. Their interaction effect further confirms that they have a complementary synergistic impact on the environment of the 24 EU countries. It thus implies that both green trade and economic complexity act better together than separately. Countries interested in achieving sustainable environment can do so by raising local productive capabilities, such that they are able to quickly transition into the production of technology-intensive, eco-friendly items. Alternatively, they can also explore the unique benefits provided by international trade in green products in cases where they do not have the ability to locally produce certain green goods. Better still, they can pursue both objectives simultaneously.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin] Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gyamfi, Bright Akwasi] Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Econ & Finance Applicat & Res Ctr, Istanbul, Turkey",Nanchang University; Istanbul Ticaret University; Istanbul Ticaret University,"Olasehinde-Williams, G (corresponding author), Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",goowilliams@ticaret.edu.tr,,,,,,,,0,0,12,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

The obtained tungsten-doped TiO2 core-shell nanowires have an amorphous shell with a rough surface, In which W species are incorporated into the amorphous TiO2 shell during this simultaneous etching/regrowth step for the optimization of photoelectrochemical performance. Photoanodes made of these W-doped TiO2 core-shell nanowires show a much enhanced photocurtent density of similar to 153 mA/cm(2) at 0.23 V vs Ag/AgCl (123 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), almost 225% of that of the pristine TiO2 nanowire photoanodes. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement and the density functional theory calculation demonstrate that the substantially improved performance of the dual W-doped and etched TiO2 nanowires Is attributed to the enhancement of charge transfer and the increase of charge carrier density, resulting from the combination effect of etching and W-doping. This unconventional, simultaneous etching and doping of pregrown nanowires is facile and takes place under moderate conditions, and it may be extended for other dopants and host materials with increased photoelectrochemical performances.","[Wang, Yongcheng; Tang, Jing; Wu, Haoyu; Xu, Ming; Peng, Zheng; Zheng, Gengfeng] Fudan Univ, Dept Chem, Adv Mat Lab, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Yu; Gong, Xin-Gao] Fudan Univ, Key Lab Computat Phys Sci, Minist Educ, State Key Lab Surface Phys, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Yu; Gong, Xin-Gao] Fudan Univ, Dept Phys, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zheng, GF (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Chem, Adv Mat Lab, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",gfzheng@fudan.edu.cn,,,"National Key Basic Research Program of China [2013CB934104, 2012CB921400]; NSF of China [21322311, 21071033]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-10-0357]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [10PJ1401000]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; NSF of China; Fudan University",National Key Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fudan University,"G.Z. thanks the following funding agencies for supporting this work: the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB934104), the NSF of China (21322311, 21071033), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-10-0357), the Shanghai Pujiang Program (10PJ1401000), and the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning.

It conceptualizes 'prosperity' in terms of ecological sustainability, social inclusion, and the quality of life and contextualizes this definition in global perspective. Subsequently, it operationalizes and measures these dimensions on the basis of data from sources such as the World Bank, the Global Footprint Network and the OECD for 138 countries and by applying dual multiple factor analysis. Building on earlier research that suggested that higher development levels in terms of GDP per capita are capable of providing social and individual prosperity but at the expense of environmental sustainability, we ask whether other interrelations between prosperity indicators exist on other levels of economic development. Empirically distinguishing between 'rich', 'emerging', 'developing' and 'poor countries' the paper finds that social and individual prosperity indicators largely increase with economic development while ecological sustainability indicators worsen. Our analyses further reveal that 'social cohesion' can be established under different economic and institutional conditions, that subjective wellbeing increases with income rises at all levels of economic development and that a decoupling of carbon emissions from the provision of prosperity is, in principle, achievable, while a reduction of the global matter and energy throughput poses a much greater challenge. The paper concludes by highlighting the repercussions of these findings for the trajectories that countries at different levels of economic development would need to undertake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8's focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction. We trace key historical debates on work to argue that both gender and labour rights have to underpin SDG 8 if its promise of inclusive, sustainable and decent work is to be realized.

Most often, they have been promoted as tools to foster sustainable development albeit they differ in terms of specific objectives. While many case studies have tried to assess the actual impact of these systems, there has been no global analysis summarizing their global impact. This paper aims to fill the gap by exploring whether complementary currencies contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development. We use the systematic review methodology on an original dataset gathering most academic publications on the topic in English, French and Spanish. Our main findings suggest that community currencies mostly contribute to social sustainability, and that their economic benefits are somewhat limited due to their small scale and the lack of awareness on their scope. Moreover, very few studies explicitly identify environmental outcomes. Finally, this review reveals some limits regarding current methods for impact assessment in this field. Therefore it encourages more standardization to provide greater accuracy and strengthen the legitimacy of community currencies in order to foster their continued development. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study demonstrates how consumer decisions, particularly in relation to price sensitivity, have a significant influence on CE adoption and therefore on global sustainability. An integrated planetary model representing the world through 15 ecological-industrial compartments is considered. The functioning of the model is governed by food web dynamics and a macro-economic model. A circulation industry compartment recycles used products going to waste. The consumer price sensitivity for the circulated goods is captured by considering the consumers' cumulative CE participation (CCEP). Different CCEP patterns are studied for a variety of consumption increase rates. The results show that greater preference for circulated goods avoided system collapse, and corresponding CCEP patterns identify the sustainable zone (TSZ). A parametric study of combinations of CCEP patterns and consumption growth rates showed that with the higher consumption growth rate (four to six times linear increase of consumption over simulation horizon), the TSZ shrinks (50%). Moreover, at higher consumption growth rates, more economic incentives are required to obtain a similar ecosystem response. Finally, at a very high level of CE adoption, the overall population becomes less wealthy. Thus, preventing the consumption growth rather than promoting the CE through subsidies is more desirable from economic and ecological perspectives.","[Hanumante, Neeraj C.] Indian Inst Technol, IITB Monash Res Acad, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Hanumante, Neeraj C.; Shastri, Yogendra] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Room 311, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Hanumante, Neeraj C.; Hoadley, Andrew] Monash Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Monash University,"Shastri, Y (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Room 311, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",yshastri@iitb.ac.in,,,"Tata Chemicals Ltd., India; Prime Minister's Fellowship Scheme for Doctoral Research","Tata Chemicals Ltd., India; Prime Minister's Fellowship Scheme for Doctoral Research","Tata Chemicals Ltd., India; PrimeMinister's Fellowship Scheme forDoctoral Research.",,,0,0,4,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,J IND ECOL,J.

Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the 'environmental issue' is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.","[Gills, Barry; Morgan, Jamie] Leeds Beckett Univ, Business Sch, Sch Econ Analyt & Int Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University,"Morgan, J (corresponding author), Leeds Beckett Univ, Business Sch, Sch Econ Analyt & Int Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",j.a.morgan@leedsbeckett.ac.uk,,,,,,,,13,13,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,GLOBALIZATIONS,Globalizations,OCT 3,2021,18,7,,,SI,,1189,1205,,10.1080/14747731.2020.1808413,0,,SEP 2020,17,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,WO7JI,,Green Accepted,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000566614600001,0,en

Diverse alternative discourses challenge its dominance. This paper reviews alternative discourses to surface discursive common ground and conflicts, arguing that this is an important step towards the formation of discourse coalitions that could rival the political power of neoliberal capitalism. There is common ground in how alternative discourses see the world (systems and networks), their normative relationship with nature (sustainable, regenerative or planetcentric) and with each other (cooperative and entangled), their goals (wellbeing, justice and plurality) and some of the strategies for transformation (participatory governance, a new economic system, prioritizing different human values and participatory knowledge practices). There are also important conflicts that could offer productive sites for agonistic dialogue between plural discourses. These common and conflicting memes may be seeds of the discursive transformation that is essential to support flourishing, sustainable futures.","[Riedy, Chris] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Riedy, C (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",criedy@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,,9,9,2,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

While complexification can be an effective problem-solving strategy, over-complexification can cause environmental degradation and lead systems to become increasingly dependent on external subsidies and vulnerable to collapse. Here, we explore a wide array of evidence of complexification and over-complexification in contemporary global food systems, drawing on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization and elsewhere. We find that food systems in developed, emerging, and least developed countries have all followed a trajectory of complexification, but that return on investments for energy and other food system inputs have significantly declined-a key indicator of over-complexification. Food systems in developed countries are further along in the process of over-complexification than least developed and emerging countries. Recent agricultural developments, specifically the introduction of genetically modified crops, have not altered this trend or improved return on investments for inputs into food systems. Similarly, emerging innovations belonging to the digital agricultural revolution are likewise accompanied by energy demands that may further exacerbate over-complexification. To reverse over-complexification, we discuss strategies including innovation by subtraction, agroecology, and disruptive technology.","[Loring, Philip A.] Univ Guelph, Arrell Food Inst, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Sanyal, Palash] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Saskatchewan; Global Institute for Water Security,"Loring, PA (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Arrell Food Inst, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Guelph, ON, Canada.",phil.loring@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,,1,1,2,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

This results in a balancing problem: To what extent environmental protection and sustainability can be balanced with economic growth within the ECB's monetary policy?

Concerns have been raised about the implications for biodiversity. Here, we present a review of current research on the two approaches to determine their relationship to each other and to other economic models, their impact on sustainability and their relationship with biodiversity. Bioeconomy and circular economy are both poorly defined, inconsistently implemented and inadequately measured, and neither provides a clear pathway to sustainability. Many actors promote goals around economic growth above environmental issues. Biodiversity is often addressed indirectly or inadequately. Furthermore, many traditionally disadvantaged groups, including women and indigenous people, may be neglected and rarely engage or benefit. These challenges are compounded by capacity gaps and legal and governance complexities around implementation, influenced by traditional mindsets and approaches. Countries and companies need to plan their sustainability strategies more explicitly around the biodiversity they impact. Opportunities include the relevance and timeliness of sustainable economics for delivering Sustainable Development Goals in a post-COVID world, the existence of work to be built on, and the diversity of stakeholders already engaged. We propose five main steps to ensure the sustainability of economic approaches. Ultimately, we can ensure sustainability only by starting to shift mindsets and establishing a more focused agenda for bioeconomy and circular economy that puts species, ecosystems and the wellbeing of local people at the center.","[Stephenson, P.

MSIs include a wide array of non-governmental organisations, voluntary sustainability standards and reporting tools. However, MSIs can be critiqued as an incremental rather than transformative approach to environmental sustainability, firmly embedded within a green-growth paradigm. This article examines the limits and opportunities of MSIs in aiding a systemic transformation for sustainability within the fashion system. By analysing fashion-specific MSIs at two time points, 2017 and 2021, we identify that while MSI membership is growing and a degree of consolidation and harmonisation is occurring, environmental gains are offset by unrelenting growth in production. Drawing upon principles of degrowth, we propose that a scenario in which an MSI construct could have transformative power is one in which overproduction is explicitly addressed.","[Payne, Alice; Mellick, Zoe] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Payne, A (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",a1.payne@qut.edu.au,,,"Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) , 'Improving the ability of the Australian cotton industry","Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) , 'Improving the ability of the Australian cotton industry","The original 2017 dataset for this study was gathered through a project funded by the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) , 'Improving the ability of the Australian cotton industry to report its sustainability performance', 2016-18.",,,0,0,0,1,QUEENSLAND UNIV TECHNOLOGY,BRISBANE,"GPO  BOX 2434, BRISBANE, QLD 4001, AUSTRALIA",,,,INT J CRIME JUSTICE,Int.

This impurity structure and its interplay with Mg impurities in Al(x)Ga(1-x)N semiconductors are relevant to develop the p-type nitride crystals for various devices (e.g, LEDs, transistors, gas sensors) but are still unclear. Here we have investigated Mg-doped Al0.5Ga0.5N before and after postgrowth annealing with valence-band and core-level photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and resistivity measurements. First, it is found that a surface part of the Al0.5Ga0.5N crystal is surprisingly inert with air and stable against air exposure-induced changes. Thus, the relatively surface-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reflect in this case also the bulk crystal characteristics. The measurements reveal the presence of deep states up. to 1 eV above valence-band maximum before and after the annealing and that oxygen and carbon, occupy N lattice sites (i.e., O-N and C-N). The model where C-N-induced acceptor states in the band gap participate in the blue emission (photoluminescence) is supported. Furthermore, the presented Mg 2p core-level spectra demonstrate that part of Mg atoms forms direct bond(s) with oxygen in the bulklike structure of Al0.5Ga0.5N and that the chemical environment of Mg atoms is much richer than was expected previously.","[Makela, Jaakko; Tuominen, Marjukka; Nieminen, Tiina; Yasir, Muhammad; Kuzmin, Mikhail; Dahl, Johnny; Punkkinen, Marko; Laukkanen, Pekka; Kokko, Kalevi] Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Lastusaari, Mika] Univ Turku, Dept Chem, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Lastusaari, Mika] Univ Turku, Ctr Mat & Surfaces MatSuff, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Huhtinen, Hannu; Paturi, Petriina] Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, Wihuri Phys Lab, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Kuzmin, Mikhail] Russian Acad Sci, Ioffe Phys Tech Inst, RU-194021 St Petersburg, Russia; [Osiecki, Jacek; Schulte, Karina] Lund Univ, MAX Lab 4, POB 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",University of Turku; University of Turku; University of Turku; University of Turku; Russian Academy of Sciences; St. Petersburg Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Ioffe Physical Technical Institute; Lund University,"Laukkanen, P (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",pekka.laukkanen@utu.fi,,,CIMO; Academy of Finland [259213]; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme CALIPSO; Academy of Finland (AKA) [259213] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),CIMO; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); European Community's Seventh Framework Programme CALIPSO; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),We thank the MAX-lab staff for their assistance.

We subsequently review these policy areas through the lens of multi-level governance (MLG) to understand what scales of policy action are required for these aims to be achieved. We find that, whilst core elements of a UK GND, such as reforms to the financial system, and expansionary fiscal and monetary policy require policy change at national and supra-national level, the majority of GND investments require implementation at the local level.

However, Bhutan is not immune from pressures that have led other states to see economic growth as a core political imperative. It thus represents a valuable case to examine the possibilities and challenges facing an ecological politics of sufficiency that questions the infinite growth of production and consumption. In addition to providing an overview of the GNH development approach, the article examines how ideas of sufficiency have been incorporated into that approach and asks whether pursuit of GNH actually represents a break with logic of a growth-based economic system. Although a sufficiency-based critique of consumerism and endless growth remains present, this strong GNH formulation increasingly contends with a weak GNH that is more in line with contemporary pressures for growth and greater consumption.","[Hayden, Anders] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Hayden, A (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, 6299 South St,Rm 352,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",anders.hayden@dal.ca,,,,,,,,20,19,1,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,,,J ENVIRON DEV,J.

Using a Stock-Flow Consistent approach based on the Lotka-Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear monetary dynamics of underemployment and income distribution with abatement costs. A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 degrees C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the long-term (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 degrees C target.","[Giraud, Gael; Mc Isaac, Florent] AFD, 5 Rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France; [Bovari, Emmanuel; Giraud, Gael] Paris 1 Univ Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Bovari, Emmanuel; Giraud, Gael; Mc Isaac, Florent] Inst Louis Bachelier, Chair Energy & Prosper, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France",,"Mc Isaac, F (corresponding author), AFD, 5 Rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France.",mcisaacf@afd.fr,,,Chair Energy Prosperity; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project MeET-MaDyS) [ANR-15-CE05-0028],Chair Energy Prosperity; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project MeET-MaDyS)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to three anonymous referees for their fruitful comments and suggestions.

The paper provides an overview of the various ways in which demarketing has been applied in a tourism context and assesses the relative value of demarketing as a means of contributing to sustainability and degrowing tourism. It is argued that demarketing can make a substantial contribution to degrowing tourism at a local or even regional scale, but that the capacity to shift visitation in space and time also highlights a core weakness with respect to its contribution at other scales. The paper concludes by noting that the concept of degrowth also needs to be best understood as a continuum of which demarketing is only one aspect.","[Hall, C.

It offers a good opportunity to reinvigorate sustainable development research for two main reasons. First, it comprises many areas of SD research, which have become mainstream thanks to the UN SDGs. Second, the fact that the UN and its member countries have committed to attaining SDGs by 2030 has added a sense of urgency to the need to perform quality research on SD on the one hand, and reiterates the need to use the results of this research on the other. Even though the basic concept of sustainability goes back many centuries, it has only recently appeared on the international political agenda. This is partly due to an awakening of the fact that the human ecological pressure on the planet is still much larger than what nature can renew or compensate for. Based on this state of affairs, this paper presents an outline of the process leading to the agreement on the UN SDGs, and looks at some of the ecological aspects as a result of continued pressure of human activities on natural resources. Furthermore, a set of research needs is proposed - also based holistically on updated research trends - discussing the degree of urgency of some measures and explaining why the UN SDGs need to be accorded greater priority in international sustainable development research efforts.","[Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Aveiro, Portugal; [Azeiteiro, Ulisses] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Fatima] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Coimbra, Portugal; [Alves, Fatima] Univ Aberta, Dept Social Sci & Management, Lisbon, Portugal; [Pace, Paul] Univ Malta, Ctr Environm Educ & Res, Msida, Malta; [Mifsud, Mark] Univ Passo Fundo, Fac Engn & Architecture, Passo Fundo, Brazil; [Brandli, Luciana; Caeiro, Sandra S.] Univ Aberta, Dept Sci & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Caeiro, Sandra S.; Disterheft, Antje] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Environm Engn, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Caparica, Portugal",Manchester Metropolitan University; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade Aberta; University of Malta; Universidade de Passo Fundo; Universidade Aberta; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England.",w.leal@mmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,,156,157,12,114,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",,,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Interpreting Daly's Definition at the National Level,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,degrowth; industrial ecology; material flow accounting; social metabolism; steady-state economy; throughput,PROGRESS; ENERGY; STOCKS; FLOWS,"Within this article, I investigate a number of the conceptual issues that arise when attempting to translate Herman Daly's definition of a steady-state economy (SSE) into a set of national biophysical indicators. Although Daly's definition gives a high-level view of what would be held steady in an SSE, it also leaves many questions unanswered. How should stocks and flows be aggregated? What is the role of international trade? How should nonrenewable resources be treated? And where does natural capital fit in? To help answer these questions, I relate Daly's definition to key concepts and terminology from material and energy flow accounting. I explore topics such as aggregation, international trade, the relevance of throughput, and hidden flows. I conclude that a set of biophysical accounts for an SSE should include three types of indicators (stocks, flows, and scale), track how stocks and flows are changing over a 5- to 10-year period, use aggregated data that measure the quantity of resource use (rather than its quality), measure both total and nonrenewable resource use, adopt a consumption-based approach, include hidden flows, and exclude indicators that measure characteristics of the stock of natural capital (with the notable exception of indicators that measure the regenerative and assimilative capacities of ecosystems).","[O'Neill, Daniel W.] Univ Leeds, Ecol Econ, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [O'Neill, Daniel W.] Ctr Adv Steady State Econ, Arlington, VA USA",N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds,"O'Neill, DW (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",d.oneill@leeds.ac.uk,,,International Research Scholarship at the University of Leeds; Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy,International Research Scholarship at the University of Leeds; Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy,"The author thanks Tim Foxon, Julia Steinberger, Peter Victor, Herman Daly, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on this work.

The sphere of culture provides the fundamental base for reading and changing the paradigmatic paths through the contents and acts of formal and informal stakeholders. Culture is deeply interlinked with other departments of the entire economy by connections with feedback loops. The impacts of culture on the socio-economic and natural environment, as the fourth pillar of sustainable development, are recognized on the international level by theory, expert groups, and practice.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to bring about a deeper understanding of participatory processes and their importance for strategic priority areas of cultural policy development.Study design/methodology/approach: Our study design included institutional analysis, starting from the regulatory framework that reflects cultural policy and its strategic goals, by involving previous relevant theoretical research including the ICET model. Another objective of the paper is to answer a range of questions. What are participation processes' main characteristics and challenges in culture and cultural policy development? Is there a relationship between these challenges? How to achieve desirable cultural and institutional integrative transformations in order to accomplish the strategic priority areas of cultural policy?

We begin by underlining systemic issues that exacerbate inequalities, highlighting the need for a 'leisure for all' contributing to system change. We briefly critique dominant approaches to promoting sport and physical activity to target inequalities, suggesting three potential improvements: first, diverting attention from organized sport towards personally meaningful physical activities; second, focusing on bottom-up collective opportunities, rather than top-down ones; third, advocating for system change to foster hope and tackle societal issues at their roots. To this end, we propose Co-PA as an approach to physical activity for social justice, suggesting three core features: (i) meaning and enjoyment; (ii) collective engagement; and (iii) a post-capitalist outlook.

In this paper, we engage with theoretical and empirical observations to reflect on how the promise of sustainable economic growth arising from the convergence of international conservation policies and the blue growth paradigm, has failed to materialise and caused huge social and economic inequities among local fishing communities and the catastrophic disruption of the socio-ecological system of fisheries. Drawing on various interventions in Malta, we illustrate how neoliberal policies, lauded and promoted as part of a national blue growth strategy, are suffocating and marginalising small-scale fishing communities by concentrating fishing opportunities into fewer, larger corporate hands, and by a hegemonic anti-small scale fishing narrative that seeks to replace traditional fishing with the 'darlings of the new blue economy', aquaculture and coastal tourism. With artisanal-commercial fishing in Malta on the verge of extinction, we call for reversal of neo-liberal policy measures to re-create a more resilient and stable fisheries economy through specific blue degrowth measures including improved access to fisheries resources and markets, and the establishment of marine protected areas that recognize the value of small-scale fisheries to conservation. This could be achieved through equity-based governance systems, including improved profit distribution systems within community economies, that grant small-scale fisheries the possibility of re-institutionalizing their sector and promoting their existence and viability into the future. Ultimately, we demonstrate that through a blue economy roadmap for small-scale fisheries, small-islands states like Malta, can rescue an important component of their maritime traditions, and be better placed to reach the obligations set out within the United Nations sustainable development goals.","[Said, Alicia] IFREMER, IUEM AMURE, Ctr Law & Econ Sea, Brest, France; [Said, Alicia; MacMillan, Douglas] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury, Kent, England",Ifremer; University of Kent,"Said, A (corresponding author), IFREMER, IUEM AMURE, Ctr Law & Econ Sea, Brest, France.;Said, A (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury, Kent, England.",alicia.said@ifremer.fr,,,,,,,,18,18,2,17,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

This paper starts from an analysis of the likely availability of metals in the near future and then proceeds to investigate political concerns raised by considering the geological fundamentals of social development at the peripheries of the capitalist world-system. The inequality of metal stocks, future metal requirements and the ensuing political challenges are investigated, taking copper as an example. The final section is dedicated to the discussion of regulatory challenges in view of multiple constraints on metal extraction.

This study examines how this new normal is associated with critical environmental dynamics (i.e., biodiversity, water, forest, agriculture, emissions) in areas and groups with different socio-environmental characteristics (i.e., income groups, continents, forest cover, biome, environmental performance index). Mixed results are shown. For instance, we find a deterioration in terrestrial and marine biodiversity, especially in middle- and high-income countries in Africa and Europe. This includes a reduction in the global fish stock, driven by countries in Africa. In contrast, the Great Stagnation is associated with reductions in PM2.5 (lower- and upper mid-income countries), CH4 emissions (upper mid-income countries and Europe), forest loss (upper mid-income countries and Asia), and increases in species habitat index (across most groupings). Our evidence indicates that periods of economic slowdown, such as the great stagnation, on their own cannot ensure a transition to a sustainable socio-environmental system and may be associated with significant negative environmental effects. Managing our transition to sustainability will require concerted policy efforts across multiple environmental domains, not only on carbon emissions, and during periods of both strong and weak economic growth rates.","[Cantone, Bernardo] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Cantone, Bernardo; Antonarakis, Alexander S.; Antoniades, Andreas] Univ Sussex, Sussex Sustainabil Res Programme, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Antonarakis, Alexander S.] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton, E Sussex, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Sussex; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Sussex; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Sussex,"Antoniades, A (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Int Relat, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",a.a.antoniades@sussex.ac.uk,,,Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP),Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP),Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP),,,5,5,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

This paper addresses the complex and partly contradictory responses to these two crises, investigating their social anatomies. Using temporality, spatiality, and epistemic authority as the main conceptual vehicles, the two crises are systematically compared. Despite sharing a number of similarities, the most striking difference between the two crises is the urgency of action to counter the rapid spread of the pandemic as compared to the slow and meager action to mitigate longstanding, well-documented, and accelerating climate change. Although the tide now seems to have turned towards a quick and massive effort to restore the status quo-including attempts to restart the existing economic growth models, which imply an obvious risk for substantially increasing CO(2)emissions-the article finally points at some signs of an opening window of opportunity for green growth and degrowth initiatives. However, these signs have to be realistically interpreted in relation to the broader context of power relations in terms of governance configurations and regulatory strategies worldwide at different levels of society.","[Lidskog, Rolf; Elander, Ingemar; Standring, Adam] Orebro Univ, Sch Humanities Educ & Social Sci, SE-70281 Orebro, Sweden; [Elander, Ingemar] Malardalen Univ, Sch Business Soc & Engn, SE-72220 Vasteras, Sweden",Orebro University; Malardalen University,"Lidskog, R (corresponding author), Orebro Univ, Sch Humanities Educ & Social Sci, SE-70281 Orebro, Sweden.",rolf.lidskog@oru.se; ingemar.elander@oru.se; adam.standring@oru.se,,,Swedish Research Council [2018-01634],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"This research was funded by The Swedish Research Council, grant number 2018-01634.",,,14,14,1,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2020,12,16,,,,,,,6337,10.3390/su12166337,0,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OD0UG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000579568700001,0,en

However, compared with the wealth of studies on 'born sustainable' start-ups, there is minimal case study or interview based research into how incumbent companies are approaching this transition. Focusing on plastics, we ask: how does one incumbent multinational company approach the circular economy transition? This paper presents a case study of the incumbent multinational chemical company Dow, a leading plastics manufacturer. Varied external stressors and drivers for the circular economy act upon a company (which also has its own imperatives), resulting in tentative steps towards circular economy. To date, these steps have tweaked the existing system rather than radically altering the business model. For companies, like for the entire global economy, this transition has only just begun. This paper identifies key drivers, enablers and barriers of the circular economy, none of which are fixed or immutable. Knowing which levers for change are available and effective could help policy makers to shift gear to enable quicker progress towards circularity. Overall, broad based support and engagement is needed to progress the circular economy, hence all stakeholders have roles to play in demanding and enacting circular practices.","[Barford, Anna; Ahmad, Saffy Rose] Univ Cambridge, Inst Sustainabil Leadership, 1 Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1QA, England",University of Cambridge,"Barford, A (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Inst Sustainabil Leadership, 1 Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1QA, England.",ab423@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,,2,2,10,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

Although short-term beneficial or adverse impacts on biodiversity have been widely discussed, there is less attention to the likely political and economic responses to the crisis and their implications for conservation. Here we describe four possible alternative future policy responses: (1) restoration of the previous economy, (2) removal of obstacles to economic growth, (3) green recovery and (4) transformative economic reconstruction. Each alternative offers opportunities and risks for conservation. They differ in the agents they emphasize to mobilize change (e.g. markets or states) and in the extent to which they prioritize or downplay the protection of nature. We analyse the advantages and disadvantages of these four options from a conservation perspective. We argue that the choice of post-COVID-19 recovery strategy has huge significance for the future of biodiversity, and that conservationists of all persuasions must not shrink from engagement in the debates to come.","[Sandbrook, Chris; Adams, William M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Oslo, Norway; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway",University of Cambridge; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Sandbrook, C (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",cgs21@cam.ac.uk,,,Norwegian Institute of Nature Research [81151842],Norwegian Institute of Nature Research,"EG-B received partial funding from the strategic resources of the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research (project number: 81151842).

In this retrospective, as the retiring Editor-in-Chief, I provide a set of personal reflections on the changing landscape of scholarship in the field. This historical overview traces developments from the journal's origins in debates between philosophers, so-ciologists, and economists in the UK to the conflicts over policy on climate change, biodiversity/non-humans and sustainability. Along the way various negative influences are mentioned, relating to how the values of Nature are considered in policy, including mainstream environmental economics, naive environmental pragmatism, the strategic role of corporations, neoliberalism and eco-modernism/techno-optimism. At the same time core value debates around intrinsic value in Nature and instrumentalism remain relevant, along with how plural environmental values can be articulated and acted upon. Naturalness, human relations to non-humans, and Nature as other, remain central consid-erations. The broadening of issues covered by the journal (e.g. covering social psychology, sociology and political science), reflect the need to address both human behaviour and the structure of social and economic systems to confront ongoing social-ecological crises.","[Spash, Clive L.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Spash, CL (corresponding author), WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",,,,Executive board of Environmental Values,Executive board of Environmental Values,"Acknowledgements Thanks to those with whom I have worked on the executive board of Environmental Values over the years.

Graphene forms directly on metallic Cu during the high-temperature hydrocarbon exposure, whereby an upshift in the binding energies of the corresponding C1s XPS core level signatures is indicative of coupling between the Cu catalyst and the growing graphene. Minor carbon uptake into Cu can under certain conditions manifest itself as carbon precipitation upon cooling. Postgrowth, ambient air exposure even at room temperature decouples the graphene from Cu by (reversible) oxygen intercalation. The importance of these dynamic interactions is discussed for graphene growth, processing, and device integration.

In this paper, I argue that organizations act as systems of ocean destruction, and I explore how to operate a shift to organizations as systems of ocean conservation and thriving, enabling human-ocean socio-ecological coviability. To do so, I analyze the organizational affordances of the ocean: incommensurability, open access and complex property regimes, structural domination by humans and land, perceived inexhaustibility, and cognitive distance. Then, based on the transdisciplinary analysis of mechanisms of ocean destruction, I discuss the constitution of ocean negative commons and the ruining of the ocean. Lastly, based on four drivers (technology and innovation, consumption, marginalization and social orders), I suggest alternative organizing principles that might allow to manage these commons and to transform organizations to achieve socio-ecological coviability with the ocean: degrowth, total responsibility, full cost allocation, ocean equity, and adaptive, place-based co-management.","[Berkowitz, Heloise] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7317, 35 Ave Jules Ferry, F-13626 Aix En Provence 1, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Berkowitz, H (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7317, 35 Ave Jules Ferry, F-13626 Aix En Provence 1, France.",heloise.berkowitz@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,BUS SOC REV,Bus.

It aims at identifying existing as well as potential (yet missing) links between the finance industry and local businesses that aspire to more sustainable economic practices. Building on the observation that green investments have been gaining weight in global investors' strategies, we analyse how sustainable - in the most comprehensive sense of the word -green investments could ultimately be(come), when green assets are still managed according to the logic of financialised finance. This latter's technologies of commodification, securitisation and derivatives-trading allegedly oppose alternative economic practices that pursue economic sustainability through social and environmental gains. In contrast, we investigate how the finance industry relates to alternative financial practices, products and organisations that offer sustainability-oriented financing services, - for example, regional banks, cooperatives and the like, - with a specific focus on green, social and solidarity businesses. Both approaches subscribe to apparently contradictory ideologies. We establish a beneficial dialogue between the opposing models of green capitalism and alternative economies so as to identify potential points of intersection. The context of Luxembourg's local/regional economies provides a great opportunity to empirically access three levels of investigation: the private sector, the public sector and an international financial centre, a key facilitator for green finance, thus utilising insights from the concept of bricolage. Whilst supporters of Luxembourg's emerging green finance profile recognise its positive impact on the small country's national branding, in combination with economic stimuli, more critical commentators point to pure green washing effects.","[Dorry, Sabine] LISER, Dept Urban Dev & Mobil, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Schulz, Christian] Univ Luxembourg, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Dorry, S (corresponding author), LISER, Dept Urban Dev & Mobil, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",sabine.doerry@liser.lu,,,Regional Studies Association (MeRSA research grant),Regional Studies Association (MeRSA research grant),"Sabine Dorry wishes to acknowledge funding from the Regional Studies Association (MeRSA research grant, 2015-2017).",,,33,33,20,99,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2018,23,7,,,SI,,717,733,,10.1080/13549839.2018.1428792,0,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,GG8GC,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000432934800004,0,en

Yet an increasing number of proponents, especially in international development and public policy circles, see basic income as an efficient technological solution to poverty and economic insecurity. Critical development studies scholars have overwhelmingly problematized such 'rendering technical' of complex social, economic and political issues. In this paper, we use a critical development lens to point to two areas of particular danger to the transformative potential of basic income: coloniality and class relations. We do so through two case studies: a proposed basic income for Indigenous Australians and the support of UBI by high-net-worth individuals in California's Silicon Valley. Using these two cases, we argue that despite best intentions, without critical engagement and nuance around questions of power, the radical potential of basic income may be jeopardized, with basic income becoming another technological quick-fix of development and policy interventions.

To this end, a supervision framework is developed based on the insight that knowledge of a problem is not required for solutions to that problem to emerge. Core elements of solution-focused brief therapy, systemic structural constellations, and social systems theory are combined to demonstrate that there would be better success with the higher goals of environmentalism if environmentalists focus not on problems of capitalism and growth, but on those non-economic aspects of social life that can be grown instead. An outlook shows that this shift of focus from problem to the problem ecology resonates well with ambitions to ensure sustainable development and to design alternative indices that go beyond the OECD well-being framework or the Happy Planet Index.

J,"Yanez, PP",,,,"Pano Yanez, Pablo",,,Viability of circular economy in nonindustrialised countries and its adjustment to a proposal based on transformative economies: an approach to the latin-american scenario,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Transformative economies; circular economy; circularity; strong sustainability; coverage of needs; Buen Vivir,,"In response to the evident unsustainably of linear economy a vast array of new concepts regarding the so-called alternative economies has emerged. Along the same line, this paper focuses on analyzing the definitions, applications, and debates over circular economy. The main question being to identify to which extend circular economy can be adapted and respond to the realities and needs of non-industrialized countries' societies in the global South, especially in Latin America. To do so, all main questions in which the so-called reformist and transformationist schools differ have been examined: full reduction of resources, conceptions of sustainability, and even the modification of the capitalist economic order (promoted by transformationists while unreservedly rejected by reformists). This proposal points out the limits of circular economy regarding unemployment levels, planned obsolescence, or its contribution to dematerialization and decarbonization so as to constitute a viable model. Also, its implementation does not necessarily ensure energy reduction or optimization and material consumption, and it meets with corporate resistance given that its profitability is unclear. These debates show the diversity and ambivalence of approaches and practices regarding alternative economies. Societies such as those in Latin America should examine how these economies are shaped to provide a real alternative adapted to local needs. Firstly, this article provides a state of the art through the review and contrast of multiple alternative approaches to the economy, coming from different parts of the globe with different politico-economic realities (care economy, ecological economy, economy of life, sustainability, sharing economy, degrowth, popular economy, the Common, etc.). Secondly, it aims to lay the foundations for a useful proposal tailored to countries and economies that are not rich nor industrialized but show high levels of inequality, social injustice, and serious external and internal threats regarding ecological sustainability. The results reveal that in several territories in the South some rooted circular economy practices already exist (higher rates of re-utilization and repair as well as lower consumption, which equates to reduction). Urban recycling together with agriculture and livestock farming (especially with agroecology and permaculture initiatives) provide livelihood to many people through popular economy and, in some cases, through social economy. All the above is signifall theicantly connected to Latin American conceptions regarding development, such as Buen Vivir, which deviate from a rational, productivist logic and offer alternative approaches to social justice and to living in harmony with nature. This proposal was outlined after an in-depth analysis of various results. One specific conclusion is that the concept of circularity is especially useful to lay down the guidelines of transformative economies for societies in the South as long as it is associated to a number of other premises. All these guidelines can be summarized as follows: coverage of basic human needs; strong sustainability; relevant reduction of extractivisms, popular economy/social economy, socio-economic and ecological democracy; inclusive, predistributive and fair in nature; inspired by nature, ancestral communities and other productivities; strengthening of internal and local economy linked to higher scales of economy, and finally, useful, dignified, collaborative, universal employment. From a substantial perspective that considers economy as being strictly linked to two larger systems (the society and the environment that contain it), this proposal offers a change in direction regarding the menace of unsustainability and social injustice imposed by the dominant economy (dissociated from the natural and social environment) and more patently visible in peripheral societies in the South rather than in core countries. This theoretical proposition attempts to address an issue and its existing approaches although it draws on practices that we have not directly investigated. It its therefore inevitably generic in nature and for specific applications it should be adapted to concrete ecological, sociopolitical, and economic contexts of unindustrialized societies in the South. Likewise, it sets out guidelines on indicators for the identification of sustainability, circularity, coverage of needs and social justice, which should be operationalized according to these different contexts. Still, this proposal was conceived as the theoretical and conceptual framework of a current investigative process in Ecuador on specific areas such as electronic waste management, polymers reuse, or the role of recyclers; in that sense, its purely theoretical nature is left behind as it is a key part of a set of larger joint actions. The originality of the present work relies on the manner that it connects all the concepts and debates over alternative economies -and their relation to the dominant economy- with the reality of unindustrialized countries of the global South. Importing these unadjusted models translates into unsuccessful efforts -often from public institutions- since they lack social, cultural, and economic contextualization, among others. In this sense, this comprehensive and contextualized proposal sets up the necessary guidelines for transitioning from a dominant model to alternative forms of economy.","[Pano Yanez, Pablo] Univ Cuenca, Cuenca, Ecuador",Universidad de Cuenca,"Yanez, PP (corresponding author), Univ Cuenca, Cuenca, Ecuador.",pablo.panoy@ucuenca.edu.ec,,,,,,,,0,0,16,66,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,MAR,2021,101,,,,,,289,323,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.101.15979,0,,,35,Economics,,Business & Economics,RH8OT,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000636471400010,0,en

In this study, the authors report a flexible approach to produce Fe nanocubes as building blocks for high-performance NO2 gas sensor devices, and hybrid FeAu nanocubes with magneto-plasmonic properties. Considering that nucleation happens within a short distance from the sputtering target, the authors utilize the high-permeability and resultant screening effect induced by magnetic Fe targets of various thicknesses to manipulate the magnetic field configuration and plasma confinement. The authors thus readily switch from bimodal to single-Gaussian size distributions of Fe nanocubes by modifying their primordial thermal environments, as explained by a combination of modeling methods. Simultaneously, the authors obtain a material yield increase of more than one order of magnitude compared to experiments using postgrowth mass filtration. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by the deposition of Fe nanocubes on microhotplate devices, leading to unprecedented NO2 detection performance for Fe-based chemoresistive gas sensors. The exceedingly low detection limit down to 3 ppb is attributed to a morphological change in operando from Fe/Fe-oxide core/shell to specific hollow-nanocube structures, as revealed by in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy.","[Vernieres, Jerome; Steinhauer, Stephan; Diaz, Rosa E.; Grammatikopoulos, Panagiotis; Sowwan, Mukhles] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol OIST, Nanoparticles Design Unit, 1919-1 Tancha,Onna Son, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Zhao, Junlei; Nordlund, Kai; Djurabekova, Flyura] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, POB 43, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Zhao, Junlei; Nordlund, Kai; Djurabekova, Flyura] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Phys, POB 43, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Chapelle, Audrey; Menini, Philippe; Dufour, Nicolas] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, LAAS CNRS, 7 Ave Colonel Roche, F-31031 Toulouse, France",University of Helsinki; Helsinki Institute of Physics; University of Helsinki; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Sowwan, M (corresponding author), Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol OIST, Nanoparticles Design Unit, 1919-1 Tancha,Onna Son, Okinawa 9040495, Japan.",mukhles@oist.jp,,,"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University; Academy of Finland [269696]; Finnish IT Center of Science, CSC; LAASCNRS; French RENATECH network; Academy of Finland (AKA) [269696] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)","Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University(Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Finnish IT Center of Science, CSC(Finnish IT center for science); LAASCNRS; French RENATECH network; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of Finland)","Work performed at OIST was supported by funding from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University.

The alignment of resources with the socio-economic development goals is a key issue that must be addressed for inclusive green growth. A comprehensive directional distance function and slacks-based measure model are proposed to evaluate the inclusive green growth levels of 285 cities in China from 2003 to 2015. The Luenberger indicator is used to decompose the drivers of inclusive green growth. Our research shows that the main obstacle to China's inclusive green growth is the magnitude of technical change, which is not aligned with China's green development level. Hence, it is necessary to coordinate overall inclusive green growth levels using both technical and regional aspects.

However, disinformation has become a pandemic within a pandemic with convergence of COVID-19 and digital transformation of health care, climate emergency, and pervasive human-computer interaction in all facets of life. We are living through an era of post-truth. New approaches to fight disinformation are urgently needed and of paramount importance for systems science and planetary health. In this study, we discuss the ways in which extractive and entrenched epistemologies such as technocracy and neoliberalism co-produce disinformation. We draw from the works of David Collingridge in technology entrenchment and the literature on digital health, international affairs, climate emergency, degrowth, and decolonializing methodologies. We expand the vocabulary on and interventions against disinformation, and propose the following: (1) rapid epistemic disobedience as a critical governance tool to resist the cultural hegemony of neoliberalism and its master narrative infinite growth that is damaging the planetary ecosystems, while creating echo chambers overflowing with disinformation, and (2) a two-tiered taxonomy of reflexivity, a state of self-cognizance by knowledge actors, for example, scientists, engineers, and physicians (type 1 reflexivity), as well as by chroniclers of former actors, for example, civil society organizations, journalists, social sciences, and humanities scholars (type 2 reflexivity). This article takes seriously the role of master narratives in quotidian life in production of disinformation and ecological breakdown. The infinite growth narrative does not ask critical questions such as growth in what, at what costs to society and environment?, and is a dangerous game of brinkmanship that has been testing the planetary ecological boundaries and putting at risk the veracity of knowledge. There is a need for scholars and systems scientists who break ranks with entrenched narratives that pose existential threats to planetary sustainability and are harmful to knowledge veracity. Scholars who resist the obvious recklessness and juggernaut of the pursuit of neoliberal infinite growth would be rooting for living responsibly and in solidarity on a planet with finite resources. The interventions proposed in this study, rapid epistemic disobedience and the expanded reflexivity taxonomy, can advance progressive policies for a good life for all within planetary boundaries, and decolonize knowledge from disinformation in ways that are necessarily upstream, radical, rapid, and emancipatory.","[Ozdemir, Vural] OMICS Journal Integrat Biol, New Rochelle, NY USA; [Springer, Simon] Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci, Ctr Urban & Reg Studies, Sch Environm & Life Sci,Discipline Geog & Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Ozdemir, Vural] OMICS Journal Integrat Biol, New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA; [Springer, Simon] Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci, Ctr Urban, Sch Environm & Life Sci,Discipline Geog & Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle,"Ozdemir, V (corresponding author), OMICS Journal Integrat Biol, New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA.;Springer, S (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci, Ctr Urban, Sch Environm & Life Sci,Discipline Geog & Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",OJIB@liebertpub.com; simonspringer@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4,4,8,26,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",,,,OMICS,OMICS,MAY 1,2022,26,5,,,,,247,269,,10.1089/omi.2022.0041,0,,,23,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,1G0LZ,35544326,hybrid,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000795550100001,0,en

I assert that the radical, or original institutional economics (OIE) of Thorstein Veblen, further advanced by William Dugger, have crucial insights to offer the interdisciplinary fields of political ecology and ecological economics which seek to address the underlying causes and emergent complications of the unfolding, interconnected, social, and ecological crises that define our age. This inquiry will attempt to address what appears to be either overlooked or under-explored in these research communities. Namely, that the usurpation of society's surplus production, or, the accumulation of capital, is a parasite that sustains itself not only through the exploitation of human labor, but by exploiting society and nature more broadly, resulting in the deterioration of life itself.

At least two kinds of bold change are conceivable: reform of existing societal systems (e.g., financial, economic, and governance systems), including their institutions, policies, and priorities; and transformation, understood here as the de novo development of and migration to new and improved systems. The latter has barely been explored in the scientific literature and is the focus of this concept paper. The main theses explored are that transformation is prudent, given risks, attractive, given potential benefits, and achievable, given political, social, and financial constraints. A body of literature is cited in support, but that body is necessarily small given the novelty of the topic. In particular, there are almost no papers in the scientific literature addressing the how to? of transformation, a central theme of this paper.

Because a majority of scenarios limiting global warming to 2 degrees C or 1,5 degrees C include vast deployment of BECCS, a critical discussion has emerged among experts about the moral implications of thus introducing an unproven technology into the policy realm. In this paper, we analyse this discussion as it has played out between 2013 and 2019, with a focus on how expert narratives are constructed in the mass media about the possibilities for decarbonisation within the current political-economic order. We find there are almost no narratives that support massive deployment of BECCS, and that all narratives presuppose limits to decarbonisation imposed by the current political-economic system. The perception of such limits lead some to argue, through deterministic and apolitical narratives, for the necessity of negative emissions technologies, while others argue instead that degrowth is the only solution. Thus, there is a distinct lack of positive narratives about how capitalism can bring about decarbonisation.","[Haikola, Simon; Anshelm, Jonas; Hansson, Anders] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Haikola, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Linkoping, Sweden.",simon.haikola@liu.se; jonas.anshelm@liu.se; anders.n.hansson@liu.se,,,Swedish research council Formas [2019-01973]; Seed Box - a Mistra-Formas Environmental Humanities Collaboratory,Swedish research council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Seed Box - a Mistra-Formas Environmental Humanities Collaboratory,"The original research presented in this paper has been funded within the following two projects:; - Swedish research council Formas, Opening the portfolio of negative emissions technologies: A comprehensive study of social, technoeconomic and ethical dimensions of biomass-based NETs in Sweden and Tanzania (project number 2019-01973); - The Seed Box - a Mistra-Formas Environmental Humanities Collaboratory",,,4,4,6,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,POLIT GEOGR,Polit.

At the same time, growing demand for energy globally is associated with an expansion of welfare. To avoid undesired environmental and social implications of energy developments in the long run, a systemic understanding of the dynamics promoting or preventing sustainable energy development is needed. Departing from Daly's steady state economics theory, this study conceptualizes a sustainable energy system using a systems thinking approach. Efficiency increase, the central element of Daly's theory, defined as the service/throughput ratio, is put in the center of a conceptual analysis of a sustainable energy system and is carefully scrutinized. Meadows' leverage points concept is used to facilitate an analysis of different policies that aim at promoting sustainable energy system development. This study concludes that energy policies always need to be explored as part of the broader causality structure into which they are embedded. Otherwise, their impacts on other variables in the system may be overlooked, such as in the case of efficiency increase, which is shown to have undesired side effects for the development of a sustainable energy system.","[Gladkykh, Ganna; Spittler, Nathalie; Diemer, Arnaud] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Gladkykh, Ganna; Spittler, Nathalie; Davidsdottir, Brynhildur] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University of Iceland,"Gladkykh, G (corresponding author), 50 Ave Pasteur, F-63400 Chamalieres, France.",ganna.gladkykh@uca.fr,,,European Union [675153],European Union(European Commission),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 675153.,,,9,9,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120,,,,,,121,131,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.070,0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000440123300012,0,en

Nowadays we know that dietary interventions, including fasting, extends lifespan of many organisms and can also protect against age related diseases including in humans. Therefore, the capacity of adapting to periods of food scarcity may have evolved billions of years ago not only to allow immediate organismal survival but also to be able to extend organismal lifespan or at least to lead to a healthier remaining lifespan. Planarians have been the center of attention since more than two centuries because of their astonishing power of full body regeneration that relies on a large amount of adult stem cells or neoblasts. However, they also present an often-overlooked characteristic. They are able to stand long time starvation. Planarians have adapted to periods of fasting by shrinking or degrowing. Here we will review the published data about starvation in planarians and conclude with the possibility of starvation being one of the processes that rejuvenate the planarian, thus explaining the historical notion of non-ageing planarians.

We address this question by assessing the financial impacts and macroeconomic implications of carbon pricing and public subsidies. More specifically, we evaluate the extent to which such policies are sustainable by computing the probability of remaining below two thresholds that we argue to be indicative of the stability of our current economy and climate: (1) a temperature anomaly above +2 degrees C (a commonly acknowledged target, including in the 2015 Paris Agreement, to potentially avoid nonlinearities in the climate system) and (2) a large global debt-to-output ratio of 270%. Key policy insights The upper-bound of the carbon pricing corridor advocated in the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices (2017. Report of the high-level commission on carbon prices. Washington, DC: World Bank), when implemented together with additional public subsidies on abatement costs in the private sector, is likely to successfully ensure sustainable economic growth by the end of the century. The probability that these climate policies will allow us to cap the average Earth temperature deviation at below +2.5 degrees C by the end of this century is about 50%. Without a strong public commitment, the impact of climate change on gross output and capital, which captures nonlinear effects such as tipping points, appears to be powerful enough to pull the world economy towards a debt-deflationary field, potentially leading to forced degrowth in the second half of the twenty-first century.","[Bovari, Emmanuel; Giraud, Gael] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Bovari, Emmanuel; Giraud, Gael; McIsaac, Florent] Inst Louis Bachelier, Chair Energy & Prosper, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France; [McIsaac, Florent] AFD, 5 Rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France",,"McIsaac, F (corresponding author), Inst Louis Bachelier, Chair Energy & Prosper, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France.;McIsaac, F (corresponding author), AFD, 5 Rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France.",mcisaacf@afd.fr,,,Energy and Prosperity Chair; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [DS0207],Energy and Prosperity Chair; Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This work benefited from the support of the Energy and Prosperity Chair and the financial support of the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant number DS0207).,,,7,7,5,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Eighty years later, amidst the unresolved turmoil of another comparable global capitalist economic crisis and accumulating signs of a growing environmental crisis, both a direct legacy of the operation of the 'market economy', the remedy advocated by governments and policy-makers is effectively a return to 'business as usual'. Notwithstanding various manifestations of public expression of dissatisfaction with the consequences of global 'free-market' capitalism, which include increasing inequality, poverty, unemployment, depletion of scarce natural resources, environmental destruction, pollution and waste, the default policy setting remains to restore global economic growth, to generate further increases in production and cultivate ever-rising rates of consumption, even if the risk is 'common ruin'. However, there are a number of realistic, progressive and radical alternatives proposed by critical analysts, including a political program for 'de-growth', a reinvention of communism and detailed policy proposals outlining the measures necessary to promote a transition to a 'post-capitalist' society with a sustainable economy.","Univ Portsmouth, Sch Social Hist & Literary Studies, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Smart, B (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Social Hist & Literary Studies, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, Hants, England.",barry.smart@port.ac.uk,,,,,,,,10,10,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,THEOR CULT SOC,Theory Cult.

However, empirical evidence for absolute decoupling, i.e. decreasing resource use and emissions at the required scale despite continued economic growth, is scarce and scattered across different research streams. In this two-part systematic review, we assess how and to what extent decoupling has been observed and what can be learnt for addressing the sustainability and climate crisis. Based on a transparent approach, we systematically identify and screen more than 11 500 scientific papers, eventually analyzing full texts of 835 empirical studies on the relationship between economic growth (GDP), resource use (materials and energy) and greenhouse gas emissions. Part I of the review examines how decoupling has been investigated across three research streams: energy, materials and energy, and emissions. Part II synthesizes the empirical evidence and policy implications (Haberlet al2020Environ. Res. Lett.15065003). In part I, we examine the topical, temporal and geographical scopes, methods of analysis, institutional networks and prevalent conceptual angles. We find that in this rapidly growing literature, the vast majority of studies-decomposition, 'causality' and Environmental Kuznets Curve analysis-approach the topic from a statistical-econometric point of view, while hardly acknowledging thermodynamic principles on the role of energy and materials for socio-economic activities. A potentially fundamental incompatibility between economic growth and systemic societal changes to address the climate crisis is rarely considered. We conclude that the existing wealth of empirical evidence merits braver conceptual advances than we have seen thus far. Future work should focus on comprehensive multi-indicator long-term analyses, conceptually grounded on the fundamental biophysical basis of socio-economic activities, incorporating the role of global supply chains as well as the wider societal role and preconditions of economic growth.","[Wiedenhofer, Dominik; Virag, Doris; Kalt, Gerald; Plank, Barbara; Streeck, Jan; Pichler, Melanie; Mayer, Andreas; Krausmann, Fridolin; Schaffartzik, Anke; Haberl, Helmut] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Social Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Brockway, Paul] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Fishman, Tomer] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Sch Sustainabil, Herzliyya, Israel; [Leon-Gruchalski, Bartholomaeus] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Safety & Risk Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Creutzig, Felix] Mercator Inst Global Commons MCC, Berlin, Germany; [Hausknost, Daniel] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Change & Sustainabil, Vienna, Austria; [Schaffartzik, Anke] Univ Autonoma Barcelona ICTA UAB, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain; [Sousa, Tania] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal; [Creutzig, Felix] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds; Reichman University; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Technical University of Berlin","Wiedenhofer, D (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Social Ecol, Vienna, Austria.",dominik.wiedenhofer@boku.ac.at,,,"European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MAT_STOCKS) [741950]; Austrian Science Funds (FWF) [MISO P27590]; UK Research Council under EPSRC Fellowship award; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the 'Maria de Maeztu' program for Units of Excellence [MDM-2015-0552]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [T 949-G27]; EPSRC [EP/R024251/1] Funding Source: UKRI","European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MAT_STOCKS); Austrian Science Funds (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); UK Research Council under EPSRC Fellowship award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the 'Maria de Maeztu' program for Units of Excellence(Spanish Government); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MAT_STOCKS, Grant Agreement No 741950) and the Austrian Science Funds (FWF, Grant MISO P27590).

Two plausible emissions distribution principles are considered. Under neither the inertia principle nor the equity principle, can continuing economic growth be made compatible with requirements of climate stabilization in all three regions. This conclusion does not change significantly when plausible acceleration of emissions intensity reduction in the future is taken into account. To limit global warming to not more than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, at least two of the three large regions need to reorganize their economies to operate with zero or negative growth. Such a reorganization cannot be achieved under a capitalist economic system given the inherent tendency of capitalism towards endless accumulation. Neither is it likely to be achieved under any conceivable economic system dominated by market relations.","[Li, Minqi] Univ Utah, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Li, MQ (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",minqi.li@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,"UNIV PITTSBURGH, UNIV LIBRARY SYSTEM",PITTSBURGH,"3960 FORBES AVE, PITTSBURGH, PA 15260 USA",,,,J WORLD SYST RES,J.

The QDs are electrostatically defined in the CNT by closely spaced metallic bottom gates deposited in trenches in SiO2 by sputter deposition of Re. The carbon nanotubes are then grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) across the trenches and contacted using conventional resist-based electron beam lithography. Unlike in previous work, the devices exhibit reproducibly the characteristics of ultraclean QDs behavior even after the subsequent electron beam lithography and chemical processing steps. We specifically demonstrate the high quality using CNT devices with two narrow bottom gates and one global back gate. Tunable by the gate voltages, the device can be operated in four different regimes: (i) fully p-type with ballistic transport between the outermost contacts (over a length of 700 nm), (ii) clean n-type single QD behavior where a QD can be induced by either the left or the right bottom gate, (iii) n-type double QD, and (iv) triple bipolar QD where the middle QD has opposite doping (p-type). Our simple fabrication scheme opens up a route to more complex devices based on ultraclean CNTs, since it allows for postgrowth processing.","[Jung, Minkyung; Schindele, Jens; Nau, Stefan; Weiss, Markus; Baumgartner, Andreas; Schoenenberger, Christian] Univ Basel, Dept Phys, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Jung, M (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Dept Phys, Klingelbergstr 82, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",minkyung.jung@unibas.ch; christian.schoenenberger@unibas.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) through NCCR-Nano; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) through NCCR-QSIT; ERC project QUEST; FP7 project SE2ND; ESF Eurographene,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) through NCCR-Nano(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) through NCCR-QSIT(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ERC project QUEST(European Research Council (ERC)); FP7 project SE2ND; ESF Eurographene,"The authors thank Julia Samm and Romain Maurand for helpful discussions and technical supports.

Scanning electron microscopy analysis has revealed the formation of three different regions with varied crystallinity defined as center, dark, and surrounding matrix. Interestingly, AFM topography has not shown any surface variation of the obtained three different regions. Despite no variation in their surface topography, notable changes occur in their local conductivity, surface potential, and microstructure of their magnetic domains. C-AFM studies have shown the formation of conducting channels with three different resistivity regions. The tunneling current was enhanced nearly 50 times from the dark region (similar to 1 pA) to the center region (similar to 50 pA). MFM image analysis reveals the formation of two different magnetically active domains in the form of circles (+0.3 degrees) distributed in a surrounding matrix (-0.3 degrees) with a steep change in their magnetic phase degree. The formation of circular magnetic domains with highly distinguishable regions has suggested the potential of YIG/Si films for magnetic memory application. This work has shed light on the prospective of YIG/Si films for resistive and magnetic memory applications and fundamental aspects of growth of YIG on nongarnet substrates.","[Saroha, Anju; Dixit, Tejendra; Ganapathi, Kolla Lakshmi; Rao, Mamidanna Sri Ramachandra] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Phys, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Saroha, Anju; Dixit, Tejendra; Ganapathi, Kolla Lakshmi; Rao, Mamidanna Sri Ramachandra] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Mat Sci Res Ctr, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Saroha, Anju; Dixit, Tejendra; Rao, Mamidanna Sri Ramachandra] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Nano Funct Mat Technol Ctr, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Miryala, Muralidhar; Murakami, Masato] Shibaura Inst Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Superconducting Mat Lab, Tokyo 1358546, Japan",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Shibaura Institute of Technology,"Rao, MSR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Phys, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.;Rao, MSR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Mat Sci Res Ctr, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.;Rao, MSR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Nano Funct Mat Technol Ctr, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",msrcrao@gmail.com,,,"Department of Science and Technology (DST) [SR/NM/NAT/02-2005]; Japan Student Services Organization for the Advanced Project Based Learning, Shibaura Institute of Technology under the Top Global University Project; UGC, GOI; IIT Madras; Department of Science and Technology, India under DST INSPIRE Faculty Program [DST/INSPIRE/04/2016/001865]","Department of Science and Technology (DST)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Japan Student Services Organization for the Advanced Project Based Learning, Shibaura Institute of Technology under the Top Global University Project; UGC, GOI(University Grants Commission, India); IIT Madras; Department of Science and Technology, India under DST INSPIRE Faculty Program(Department of Science & Technology (India)Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines)","This work was supported in part by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) that led to the establishment of Nano Functional Materials Technology Centre under Grant SR/NM/NAT/02-2005 and in part by the Japan Student Services Organization for the Advanced Project Based Learning, Shibaura Institute of Technology under the Top Global University Project, Designed by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science & Technology in Japan.

The framework represents four sustainability paradigms (weak sustainability WS, a-growth AG, de-growth DG, strong sustainability SS) and five value changes (i.e. a sense of responsibility for nature, future generations, or the current generation in developing countries; aversion to inequality for the current generation or future generations). It defines solutions in terms of consumption, environment use, and welfare for representative individuals in both developed (OECD) and developing (non-OECD) countries. Solutions are characterised by efficiency (i.e. Pareto and Kaldor-Hicks) with respect to welfare and by intra- and inter-generational equality for consumption, environment use, and welfare, by confirming internal consistency and consistency with alternative equity approaches for utilitarianism (i.e. Harsanyi), egalitarianism (i.e. Arneson for welfare; Dworkin for consumption or environment use; Sen for consumption and environment use), and contractarianism (i.e. Rawls). Theoretical and operational insights are described for alternative sustainability paradigms and equity approaches. In terms of feasibility based on improved technology, decreased population, and modified consumption, the ordering is responsibility for future generations > responsibility for the current generation in developing countries > aversion to inequality for the current generation > aversion to inequality for future generations and AG > SS > DG > WS: responsibility for nature is unfeasible. In terms of internal consistency, responsibility for future generations > responsibility for the current generation in developing countries = aversion to inequality for the current generation = aversion to inequality for future generations and SS > AG > DG; WS is internally inconsistent.

It finds that the movement was not just a reaction to the economic crisis and austerity policies, but that it put forward a metapolitical critique of the social imaginary and (neo) liberal representative democracy. The diagnostic frames of the movement denunciate the subjugation of politics and justice to economics, and reject the logic of economism. The prognostic frames of the movement advance a vision of socio-ecological sustainability and of 'real democracy', each articulated differently by a 'pragmatist' and an 'autonomist' faction within the movement. It argues that frames are overarching outer boundaries that accommodate different ideologies. Ideologies can nevertheless also be put into question by antagonizing frames. Furthermore, through the lens of the Indignados critique, the distinction between materialist and post-materialist values that characterizes the New Social Movement literature is criticized, as 'real democracy' is connected to social and environmental justice as well as to a critique of economism and the 'imperial mode of living'.

This study proposes five different scenarios to reduce the working hours of full-time employees by 20% with the aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions: a three-day weekend, a free Wednesday, reduced daily hours, increased holiday entitlement and a scenario in which the time reduction is efficiently managed by companies to minimise their office space. We conceptually analyse the effects of each scenario on time use patterns through both business and worker activities, and how these might affect energy consumption in the economy. To assess which of the scenarios may be most effective in reducing carbon emissions, this analytical framework is applied as a case study for the United Kingdom. The results suggest that three of the five scenarios offer similar benefits, and are preferable to the other two, with a difference between the best and worst scenarios of 13.03 MTCO(2)e.

We bring a critical social science perspective to this framework through the notion of societal boundaries and aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of the social nature of thresholds. We start by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of planetary boundaries from a social science perspective. We then focus on capitalist societies as a heuristic for discussing the expansionary dynamics, power relations, and lock-ins of modern societies that impel highly unsustainable societal relations with nature. While formulating societal boundaries implies a controversial process - based on normative judgments, ethical concerns, and socio-political struggles - it has the potential to offer guidelines for a just, social-ecological transformation. Collective autonomy and the politics of self-limitation are key elements of societal boundaries and are linked to important proposals and pluriverse experiences to integrate well-being and boundaries.

We conclude with reflections on social freedom, defined as the right not to live at others' expense.

To demonstrate the utility of such photoetching-after-growth approach, a complex quantum dot (QD)-quantum rod (QR) dual quantum-confined domain nanocrystal heterostructure (NCH) is engineered which exhibits bright dual-band emission precisely tunable in a broad visible region. (CdSe/CdS)/ZnS/CdSe QD/barrier/multi-QR NCHs consisting of a single CdSe/CdS QD core and multiple CdSe QR branches with a wide-bandgap ZnS barrier between them are prepared through a multistep colloidal growth. The as-synthesized NCHs show a single emission band from QR; however, after photoetching, NCHs begin to display bright dual emission bands, a high-energy emission band from QR in addition to the low-energy emission band from QD. While the QD emission at 586 nm is determined by colloidal growth conditions, that of QR emission is precisely tunable in the 500-585 nm range by quantum-size-selective photoetching using a wavelength-tunable laser. Notably, the QR emission bandwidth decreases to approximate to 20 nm, which is close to that of a single CdSe nanorod, emphasizing a significant quantum-size-focusing effect of the photoetching process.","[Lim, Sung Jun] Daegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol, Div Nanotechnol, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Daegu 42988, South Korea; [Kim, Wonjung; Shin, Seung Koo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Bionanotechnol Ctr, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea",Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Lim, SJ (corresponding author), Daegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol, Div Nanotechnol, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Daegu 42988, South Korea.;Shin, SK (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Bionanotechnol Ctr, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea.",melsj@dgist.ac.kr; skshin@postech.ac.kr,,,"DGIST - Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea [19-NT-01, 19-CoE-BT-02]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018M3A7B8061653, 2013R1A2A2A01068219]; Technology Innovation Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy [10063268]","DGIST - Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Technology Innovation Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy","S.J.L. acknowledges support from the Start-Up Fund and R&D Programs of DGIST (Grant Nos. 19-NT-01 and 19-CoE-BT-02) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea.

Yet the 3D printer is not producing anything that fulfils such a comprehensive and disruptive potential. While it has become a profound agent for a commons-based future that aims to solve the global challenges of modernity, it is a tool, rather than an agent of the maker movement. This article explores the utopian potential of the 3D printer within the discourse of commons-based future-making. Along with a wide range of academic and popular literature, the sociotechnical motives of a commons-based imaginary are analyzed and discussed in their historical construction and social order. Indeed, the 3D printer revitalizes longstanding desires for social transformation, giving them fresh impetus. Because of its interpretative flexibility, the 3D printer has become a weak desire machine that allows members of the maker movement to express their utopian desires. On the one hand, the 3D printer helps make utopian desires tangible and negotiable. On the other hand, the 3D printer tends to promote a techno-positivist approach that oversimplifies social change, losing sight of alternatives and ambiguities.","[Ibach, Merle Kathleen] FHNW Acad Arts & Design Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Ibach, Merle Kathleen] Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Ibach, MK (corresponding author), FHNW Acad Arts & Design Basel, Basel, Switzerland.;Ibach, MK (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany.",merle.ibach@fhnw.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [179178],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under Grant No. 179178.,,,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,DES CULT,Des.

In 2015, we conducted an online survey of researchers' views on various aspects of this debate, such as the compatibility of global GDP growth with the 2 degrees C climate policy target, and the timing and factors of (never-) ending growth. The 814 respondents have a wide range of backgrounds, including growth theory, general economics, environmental economics, ecological economics, environmental social sciences, and natural sciences. The two main aims are: (1) to provide an overview of agreements and disagreements across research fields, and (2) to understand why opinions differ. The survey results indicate substantial disagreement across research fields on almost every posed question. Environmental problems are most frequently mentioned as a very important factor contributing to an end of economic growth. Furthermore, we find that researchers are more skeptical about growth in the context of a concrete problem like the compatibility with the 2 degrees C climate target than when considering environmental problems more generally. Many respondents suggest ideology, values and worldviews as important reasons for disagreement. This is supported by the statistical analysis, showing that researchers' political orientation is consistently correlated with views on growth.","[Drews, Stefan] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Social Environm & Econ Psychol, Fortstr 7, D-76829 H Gebaude, Landau, Germany; [van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

Despite their importance as life supporting ecosystems, forests, oceans, and wetlands are being destroyed at an accelerating rate. The conservation and restoration of mangroves, for example, are also vital for the planet to face catastrophic global warming. Based on a non-systematic literature review, we address how true mangrove conservation is incompatible with so-called sustainable development. We turn to the urgent changes needed to avoid environmental and societal collapse, promoted by the Western economic development paradigm, and address why the sustainable development approach has failed to stop environmental degradation and protect resources for next generations. Proposed solutions involve the rejection of the capital-oriented, nature-predatory systems, degrowth, a deep transformation of our energy matrix, and a shift in our nutrition to lower levels of the food chain. These are based on a profound sense of responsibility over the planet, respecting all life forms, ecosystem dynamics, and life sustaining properties of the biosphere.","[Ferreira, Alexander Cesar; de Lacerda, Luiz Drude] Univ Fed Ceara, Inst Ciencias Mar, Av Abolicao 3207, BR-60185081 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Borges, Rebecca] Univ Bremen, Fachbereich Biol Chem FB2 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",Universidade Federal do Ceara; University of Bremen,"Ferreira, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ceara, Inst Ciencias Mar, Av Abolicao 3207, BR-60185081 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",alexcrab90@hotmail.com; rebecca.borges@uni-bremen.de; ldrude@pq.cnpq.br,,,FUNCAP-INT [00159-00009.01.00/19],FUNCAP-INT,This Research was funded by FUNCAP-INT: Proc.

The case for geoengineering is incomprehensible without analyzing the social context that gave birth to it: capitalism's inability to overcome a contradiction between the need to accumulate capital, on the one hand, and the need to maintain a stable climate system on the other. Substantial emissions reductions, unlike geoengineering, are costly, rely more on social-structural than technical changes, and are at odds with the current social order. Because of this, geoengineering will increasingly be considered a core response to climate change. In light of Herbert Marcuse's critical theory, the promotion of geoengineering as a market-friendly and high-tech strategy is shown to reflect a society that cannot set substantive aims through reason and transforms what should be considered means (technology and economic production) into ends themselves. Such a condition echoes the first-generation Frankfurt School's central thesis: instrumental rationality remains irrational.","[Gunderson, Ryan] Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Petersen, Brian] No Arizona Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Recreat, Program Sustainable Communities, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Stuart, Diana] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Sustainabil, Program Sustainable Communities, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Gunderson, R (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",gunderrm@miamioh.edu; brian.petersen@nau.edu; diana.stuart@nau.edu,,,Miami University's Committee on Faculty Research,Miami University's Committee on Faculty Research,The first author would like to thank Miami University's Committee on Faculty Research for their financial contribution aiding open access publishing.,,,12,13,1,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2018,10,1,,,,,,,269,10.3390/su10010269,0,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW1TN,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000425082600260,0,en

Eleven years later, we re-examine these movements - the Cult of Wilderness, the Gospel of Eco-Efficiency and the Mantra of Environmental Justice, - focusing on the increased visibility of struggles representing Environmental justice and The Environmentalism of the Poor. Even if they are often disconnected from an organizational standpoint, glocal manifestations of resistance have emerged since the 1990s. Today, environmental movements assert common values related to place, identity, and culture. Activists' concepts such as ecological debt, environmental justice, environmental liabilities, land grabbing, environmental gentrification, corporate accountability, climate justice, food sovereignty, or economic degrowth are the keywords of the networks of the global Environmental justice movement. At the same time, such concepts support the rural and urban movements that remake place for marginalized groups, re-assert traditional practices, and protect territory from contamination, land appropriation, and real estate speculation. Some possibilities exist for cooperation between Environmental justice and the other varieties of environmentalism.

We provide an endogenous economic growth model subject to the physical limits of the real world, meaning that nonrenewable and renewable energy production costs have functional forms that respect physical constraints, and that technological level is precisely defined as the efficiency of primary-to-useful exergy conversion. The model supports the evidence that historical productions of renewable and nonrenewable energy have greatly influenced past economic growth. Indeed, from an initial almost-renewable-only supply regime we reproduce the increasing reliance on nonrenewable energy that has allowed the global economy to leave the state of economic stagnation that had characterized the largest part of its history. We then study the inevitable transition towards complete renewable energy that human will have to deal with in a not-too-far future since nonrenewable energy comes by definition from a finite stock. Through simulation we study in which circumstances this transition could have negative impacts on economic growth (peak followed by degrowth phase). We show that the implementation of a carbon price can partially smooth such unfortunate dynamics, depending on the ways of use of the income generated by the carbon pricing.","[Court, Victor; Jouvet, Pierre-Andre] Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, UMR 7235, UPL, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Court, Victor; Jouvet, Pierre-Andre] Palais Brongniart, Chaire Econ Climat, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France; [Court, Victor; Lantz, Frederic] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); IFP Energies Nouvelles,"Court, V (corresponding author), Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, UMR 7235, UPL, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.;Court, V (corresponding author), Palais Brongniart, Chaire Econ Climat, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France.;Court, V (corresponding author), IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.",victorcourt@free.fr,,,,,,,,14,14,6,58,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2018,39,1,,,,,29,57,,10.5547/01956574.39.1.vcou,0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS0PR,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000419476700002,0,en

This article argues that social work has both an opportunity and a duty to respond to this contemporary crisis, but these responses must be imaginative and courageous. The authors hope the article instigates a discussion around developing multiple practice frameworks and expand the scope of practice required for climate mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, the authors invite the reader to undertake a process of re-imaging, not only social work practice but also the current socio-political-economic climate in which we live. The ecological crisis, marked by the Anthropocene epoch, is having a major impact on the global ecosystem, and the consequences are predicted to become increasingly severe in coming decades. The turbulence and uncertainty of the crisis means social work must begin planning, reflecting and reorientating. The first half of the article contextualises the climate crisis within neoliberal capitalism, whereas the second half proposes alternatives for social work practice that attempt to exist outside these structures. We have argued that social work should have a greater focus on developing an eco-social transition which means engaging with alternative economic systems, intentional communities, community gardens and localism. These approaches can practically espouse the profession's values whilst beginning to conceptualise a response to the climate crisis that operates outside neoliberal capitalism.","[Panagiotaros, Chris Victor; Boddy, Jennifer; Gray, Tonia; Ife, Jim] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Social Sci, Liverpool, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Panagiotaros, CV (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Social Sci, Liverpool, Australia.",c.panagiotaros@westernsydney.edu.au,,,,,,,,0,0,9,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,,,BRIT J SOC WORK,Br.

Critical Realism treats them as 'possibilities' that are real because realizable. Conversely, to Wright, they are extrapolations of existing social forms whose future combination could result in socialism. As such, Bhaskar's philosophical contribution is supplemented by the Morphogenic Approach (Archer) developed for use in the social sciences. 'Real Utopias' are considered to be necessarily Actualist, thus limiting future change in social forms to those that already exist, despite transformation being 'activity dependent'. Critical Realism attaches more importance to structural and cultural constraints and to agential ingenuity in transforming them. In short, Real Utopias are realistic rather than real though preferable to existing social formations, whilst Concrete Utopias allow for new novelty, such as de-growth, giving hope for reshaping global society.","[Archer, Margaret S.] Univ Warwick, Sociol, Coventry, W Midlands, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Warwick,"Archer, MS (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Sociol, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",margaret.archer@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,,12,12,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J CRIT REALISM,J.

However, the production and usage of information and communication technologies (ICTs) require materials and energy, and the application of ICTs fosters economic growth. This paper examines whether digitalization helps or hinders an absolute decoupling of environmental throughput from economic growth. The paper combines the literature on green IT and ICT for green with studies on decoupling, i.e., the relationship between economic growth, technological change, and environmental throughput. The paper identifies several strains of the decoupling debate and connects them to the environmental implications of digitalization. We focus on the relation between digitalization and (1) the question of finite non-renewable energies, (2) the environmental Kuznets curve, (3) the role of energy consumption for economic growth, (4) efficiency improvements vis-a-vis rebound effects, and (5) the role of general purpose technologies for resource and energy demand. We find that the empirical basis regarding digitalization's relation to these four aspects is still weak and hence, further research is needed. Comparing the mitigating and the aggravating impacts of digitalization, we conclude that a more active political and societal shaping of the process of digitalization is needed to make ICT work for global environmental sustainability.","[Santarius, Tilman; Lange, Steffen] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Santarius, Tilman] Einstein Ctr Digital Futures, Wilhelmstr 67, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Santarius, Tilman] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Social Transformat & Sustainable Digitalizat, Marchstr 23, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Pohl, Johanna] Tech Univ Berlin, Ctr Technol & Soc, Kaiserin Augusta Allee 104, D-10553 Berlin, Germany; [Lange, Steffen] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Technical University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Santarius, T (corresponding author), Inst Ecol Econ Res, Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.;Santarius, T (corresponding author), Einstein Ctr Digital Futures, Wilhelmstr 67, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Santarius, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Social Transformat & Sustainable Digitalizat, Marchstr 23, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",santarius@tu-berlin.de; pohl@ztg.tu-berlin.de; steffen.lange@ioew.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UU1607B],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, grant number 01UU1607B.",,,21,21,12,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,18,,,,,,,7496,10.3390/su12187496,0,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OS7DM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000590320200001,0,en

We then show how these can be connected through research and used to generate insights with the potential for application in broader, systemic change. The first realisation is that the core ambition of ecological economics, that of addressing the scale of human environmental resource use and associated impacts, often remains an aspirational goal, rather than being applied within research. In understanding intertwined environmental and social challenges, systemic approaches (including system dynamics) should be revitalised to address the full scope of what is possible or desirable. The second realisation is that the focus on biophysical and economic quantification and methods has been at the expense of a comprehensive social understanding of environmental impacts and barriers to changeincluding the role of power, social class, geographical location, historical change, and achieving human well-being. For instance, by fetishising growth as the core problem, attention is diverted away from underlying social driversmonetary gains as profits, rent, or interest fuelled by capitalist competition and, ultimately, unequal power relations. The third realisation is that ecological economics situates itself with respect to mainstream (neoclassical) economics, but simultaneously adopts some of its mandate and blind spots, even in its more progressive camps. Pragmatic attempts to adopt mainstream concepts and tools often comfort, rather than challenge, the reproduction of the very power relations that stand in the way of sustainability transitions. We consider these three realisations as impediments for developing ecological economics as an emancipatory critical research paradigm and political project. We will not focus on or detail the failings of ecological economics, but state what we believe they are and reformulate them as research priorities. By describing and bringing these three elements together, we are able to outline an ambitious research agenda for ecological economics, one capable of catalysing real social change.","[Pirgmaier, Elke; Steinberger, Julia K.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds,"Pirgmaier, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",e.pirgmaier@leeds.ac.uk; j.k.steinberger@leeds.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),We thank the Leverhulme Trust for funding the Living Well Within Limits project.,,,36,36,0,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 1,2019,11,7,,,,,,,2001,10.3390/su11072001,0,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW2WV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000466551600178,0,en

But its promise of reconciling economic development, social welfare, and environmental sustainability has proven rather elusive. In recent years, we've seen numerous competing concepts emerge in debates about sustainable economic development. While many advance ideas of a green economy and green growth, others talk about wellbeing, gross national happiness, inclusive wealth, harmony with nature, de-growth, steady-state economy, and buenvivir (living well). This rhetorical diversity shows that there is no single vision for reconciling environmental sustainability and economic development. But the varied terminology itself obscures actual points of agreement and disagreement. This article reports on a bilingual 'Q study' of international debates about sustainable economic development. It reveals that three discourses underpin these debates: Radical Transformationism; Cooperative Reformism; and Statist Progressivism. The article dissects these discourses and contextualizes their key points of contention in wider sustainability debates over the past two decades.","[Stevenson, Hayley] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield,"Stevenson, H (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",h.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,,,Future Research Leader fellowship; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K009761/1]; ESRC [ES/K009761/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Future Research Leader fellowship; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported by a Future Research Leader fellowship (2013-2016) provided by the Economic and Social Research Council (ES/K009761/1).,,,21,21,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

Major commercial ports are fully integrated into transnational production and distribution systems, enabling the circulation of massive flows of energy and materials in the global economy. Port activity and development are usually associated with positive socio-economic effects, such as increased GDP and employment, but the industry's continuous expansion produces adverse outcomes including air and water pollution, the destruction of marine and coastal environments, waterfront congestion, health risks, and labor issues. In its quest to marry economic growth and environmental sustainability in the maritime industries, proponents of the newly coined blue growth paradigm assume the negative impacts of ports and shipping to be fixable mostly through technological innovation. This paper questions the validity of the premise that the unlimited growth of the port and shipping industries is compatible with environmental sustainability and analyses the feasibility of technological improvements to offset the sector's associated negative impacts. Based on insights from ecological economics and political ecology, ports can be described as power-laden assemblages of spaces, flows, and actors, which produce unequally distributed socio-ecological benefits and burdens at multiple scales. Focusing on the case of the Port of Barcelona, this study argues that the continuous expansion of port activity increases seldom accounted-for negative socio-environmental impacts, acquiring an uneconomic character for port cities and regions. In contrast, de-growth is presented as a radical sustainability alternative to ocean-based growth paradigms. The paper concludes by discussing its prospective 'blue' articulation in the context of maritime transportation while offering some avenues for future research and policymaking.","[Nogue-Alguero, Borja] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Nogue-Alguero, B (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",borja.nogue@mailbox.org,,,,,,,,14,14,2,29,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",,,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

These combine social, economic and environmental objectives. However, as noted in the World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, environmental integrity is essential for the healthy functioning of social and economic systems, and thus environmental protection needs to be prioritized in policy and practice. Ecological sustainability cannot be reached without realizing that population growth and economic growth, with attendant increased rates of depletion of natural resources, pollution and general environmental degradation, are the root causes of unsustainability. This article argues that to strategically address ecological unsustainability, the social, economic and political barriers to addressing the current economic model and population growth need to be overcome. Proposed strategic solutions to the current neoliberal economy are generic, namely degrowth, a steady-state economy, and a 'circular economy'. Solutions to demographic issues must be sensitive to the countries' cultural, social, political and economic factors to be effective, as fertility differs from country to country and from culture to culture. As discussed here, Mediterranean countries have the lowest fertilities in the world, while many countries in Africa and some in Asia and South America have stable but consistently high birthrates. This is discussed using three case studies-Tanzania, Italy and Cambodia, focusing on 'best case' policies that offer a more realistic hope for successful sustainability.","[Kopnina, Helen] The Hague Univ Appl Sci, Int Business Management Studies, Johanna Westerdijkpl 75, NL-2521 EN The Hague, Netherlands; [Washington, Haydn] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lowe, Ian] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Griffith University,"Kopnina, H (corresponding author), The Hague Univ Appl Sci, Int Business Management Studies, Johanna Westerdijkpl 75, NL-2521 EN The Hague, Netherlands.",h.kopnina@hhs.nl,,,,,,,,8,8,2,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",,,,EURO-MEDITERR J ENVI,Euro-Mediterr.

In this atmosphere 'green economy' was chosen as one of two central themes for the conference, building on a burgeoning body of literature on the green economy and growth. This research examines the relationship and influence between the double crisis and the rise of 'greening' as part of the solution. The aim is to understand what defines and distinguishes the proposals contained in twenty-four sources on the green economy (including policy documents by international agencies and think tanks, and research papers), and what is the meaning and implication of the rising greening agenda for sustainable development as it enters the 21st century. Through a systematic qualitative analysis of textual material, three categories of discourse that can illuminate the meaning and implication of greening are identified: 'almost business as usual', 'greening', and 'all change'. An analysis of their relationship with Dryzek's classification of environmental discourse leads to the identification of three interrelated patterns: (1) scarcity and limits, (2) means and ends, and (3) reductionism and unity-which deepen our understanding of the tensions between emerging propositions. The patterns help explain the meaning and implications of greening for sustainable development, revealing an economisation and polarisation of discourses, the persisting weak interpretation of sustainable development, and a tension between the fixing or shifting of dominant socioeconomic paradigms that underpin its conceptualisation.","[Bina, Olivia] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bina, Olivia] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon (ICS-UL); Universidade de Lisboa; Chinese University of Hong Kong","Bina, O (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Av Prof Anibal de Bettencourt 9, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.",o.c.bina.92@cantab.net,,,,,,,,169,172,3,119,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,ENVIRON PLANN C,Environ.

The context of the research is represented by the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the economic field, especially at the labor market level. This difficult situation could generate a negative impact in the sphere of traditional jobs and economic sectors. The main challenge for sustainable development in this new global situation is represented by human sustainability. Related to human sustainability, we emphasized the role played by the labor market and employability in mantling an optimal function at the social and economic level. For measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the economic sphere, we used a quantitative design based on descriptive and inferential statistics. The research variables are represented by unemployment rates in the EU-28, employability rates, educational levels, gender, economic growth, labor mobility, material deprivation, economic freedom, and human development indicators. Empirical findings present the situation of a deep economic crisis generated by economic degrowth and by high levels of unemployment rates in the EU-28. Moreover, we have observed several predictors of employability in the new pandemic context as: material deprivation by age (in the field of young people), employment rate by education (tertiary education), and economic freedom. Another important finding is related to the gender perspective. Statistical correlations estimate a positive linear correlation between gender (women) and low rates of employability in the EU-28. All these empirical results could prove valuable for scholars interested in the relations between employability and sustainability and for political decision makers involved in the effort of reducing the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic within national and trans-national economic systems.","[Gavriluta, Nicu] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Grecu, Silviu-Petru] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Polit Sci Int Relat & N European Studies, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Chiriac, Horia Costin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Publ Relat, Iasi 700506, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Grecu, SP (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Polit Sci Int Relat & N European Studies, Iasi 700506, Romania.",nicolas@uaic.ro; silviu.grecu@uaic.ro; horia.chiriac@uaic.ro,,,"Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization [11PFE]","Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization(Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization - Romania)","Authors are thankful to Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, within Program 1-Development of the national RD system, Subprogram 1.2-Institutional Performance-RDI excellence funding projects, Contract no.11PFE/30.12.2021, for financial support.",,,13,13,22,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1589,10.3390/su14031589,0,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YY6OV,,gold,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000754908500001,0,en

Little is understood about the drivers of its periodic presence and absence or how it survives unfavourable periods. Studying the effect of starvation, we evaluated the main metabolic expenses (reproduction, respiration and excretion) during those periods. P. noctiluca could shrink in size, losing up to 85% of their mass (6.6-7.1% loss day(-1)), while continuing to release eggs quasi-daily over a 28-day period. Egg production was proportional to size (mean 759 eggs day(-1) at 6 cm bell diameter), with up to 19 526 eggs released in a single spawn, thereby providing huge potential for population growth despite undergoing starvation. Small food rations decreased the rate of shrinking to 3.1% day(-1), prolonging life (49 days), potentially enhancing the chances of encountering more prey and regrowing. Metabolism increased with wet mass (allometric exponent: 0.93 for respiration, 0.82 for ammonium), however reproduction was the greatest carbon expenditure for individuals larger than 9 cm bell diameter. Temperature (9-29 degrees C) also significantly increased both respiration and, to a greater extent, excretion (Q(10) = 2.25 and 4.76). Consequentially a warming ocean may negatively affect survival rates unless prey abundance balances the increased metabolic demands.","[Lilley, Martin K.

These ideas were studied in this article as a form of futurity framing. These framings may hinder or contribute to a transition toward a circular bioeconomy by opening up or closing down alternative paradigms for thinking about plastics in the future. Based on a media analysis of four Dutch national newspapers and international academic papers, three futurity frames were found regarding the role of different types of plastics in a linear economy, a circular economy, or an economy in transition. (1) In newspapers and academic sources, traditional plastics were considered part of a linear economy. (2) In both sources, all sorts of actors saw a future for plastics with improved material properties in a transition toward a circular economy, but in combi-nation with a change in consumer behavior and waste management systems. (3) In both academic journals and newspapers, a role for plastics was envisioned in a future circular economy. However, in academic journals, the discussions focused mainly on the improvement of alternative forms of plastics such as biobased and/or biodegradable, whereas, in newspapers, recycling traditional plastics was emphasized. These findings indicate that a transition to a more circular economy may accelerate if both the closing-the-loop argument and the argument for technological innovations for biobased and biodegradable products receive equal attention in newspapers and academic journals, and are taken more into account in a societal future vision for the circular economy.","[Colijn, Ivanna; Fraiture, Fabrice; Schroen, Karin] Wageningen Univ & Res, Food Proc Engn Grp, Bornse Weilanden 9, NL-6708 WG Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gommeh, Efrat; Metze, Tamara] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandse Weg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Colijn, I (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Bornse Weilanden 9, NL-6708 WG Wageningen, Netherlands.",ivanna.colijn@wur.nl; fabrice.fraiture@wur.nl; efrat.gommeh@wur.nl; karin.schroen@wur.nl; tamara.metze@wur.nl,,,Materials Innovation Institute (M2i) [A17020]; Dutch government,Materials Innovation Institute (M2i); Dutch government,This research was carried out under project number A17020 in the framework of the research program of the Materials Innovation Institute (M2i) (http:// www.m2i.nl) supported by the Dutch government.,,,0,0,4,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

The increase in global transport flow has contributed to bringing two themes to the centre of attention: making transalpine transportation easier and reducing the negative impact of this on the Alpine environment. The resulting debate has shown that there are conflicting transport policy proposals. The main reasons behind such differences are not so much the different evaluations of the trends in transalpine transport, and not only the diverging local and national interests, but rather the implicit reference to three alternative policy paradigms: 'competition', 'sustainability' and 'de-growth'. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to identify the links between policy paradigms and the transalpine transport policy framework; 2) to propose a multilevel and multi-criteria approach to transalpine transport policy. The explicit consideration of policy paradigms and the structured participation of citizens and stakeholders are at the heart of such a new and more widely shared approach.","[Marletto, Gerardo] Univ Sassari I, DEIR, Sassari, Italy; [Marletto, Gerardo] Univ Sassari I, CRENoS, Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Marletto, G (corresponding author), Univ Sassari I, DEIR, Sassari, Italy.",marletto@uniss.it,,,,,,,,3,3,0,9,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Using data on social and biophysical indicators provided by O'Neill etal., this paper argues that it is theoretically possible to achieve a good life for all within planetary boundaries in poor nations by building on existing exemplary models and by adopting fairer distributive policies. However, the additional biophysical pressure that this entails at a global level requires that rich nations dramatically reduce their biophysical footprints by 40-50%. Extant empirical studies suggest that this degree of reduction is unlikely to be achieved solely through efforts to decouple GDP growth from environmental impact, even under highly optimistic conditions. Therefore, for rich nations to fit within the boundaries of the safe and just space will require that they abandon growth as a policy objective and shift to post-capitalist economic models.","[Hickel, Jason] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Anthropol, London, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Hickel, J (corresponding author), Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Anthropol, London, England.",j.hickel@gold.ac.uk,,,,,,,,56,56,6,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,THIRD WORLD Q,Third World Q.,,2019,40,1,,,,,18,35,,10.1080/01436597.2018.1535895,0,,,18,Development Studies,,Development Studies,HQ7YU,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000462640800002,0,en

COHENS CRITIQUE; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; DEGROWTH; CAPITALISM; POWER; ANTHROPOCENE; CONSERVATION; CAPABILITIES; ECONOMICS,"In the Virocene epoch, global pandemics such as COVID-19 disrupt the world order organized by capitalism and racial privilege, making clear the unsustainability of 'normal' ways of organizing both society and nature. Despite its failure to address these disruptions, the existing capitalist-racist system attempts to reproduce itself, posing greater risks of disease, inequalities, and injustice to the most vulnerable human and nonhuman populations. The Virocene epoch makes these workings visible, and challenges both hegemonic and counterhegemonic ways of organizing human-nature relations. Political ecology requires new emancipatory theoretical-political strategies firmly grounded in a theory of justice that embodies social and ecological rights in order to imaginatively produce new ways to counter such social and ecological crises arising from the global process of capitalism and viral activities. To this end, political ecology must develop a universal perspective on the justice-rights-power nexus with an explicit moral basis to enhance its emancipatory praxis against the globalizing challenges of the Virocene, without reproducing existing vulnerabilities and without dismissing hegemonic and counter-hegemonic narratives in the name of otherness, difference, universalism or sameness. In this article, I reconfigure the justice-rights-power nexus to dismantle oppression and injustice in pursuit of regenerative solutions. I chart an alternate 'multispecies theory of justice' building upon love as an embodiment of the moral foundations for critical multispecies justice praxis, which produces another world of diverse, interconnected communities committed to social and ecological wellbeing. The 'Lovecene' is an aspirational planetary-order shaped by multispecies (human and non-human) equality and justice that transcends the anthropocentricism of current periodizations of planetary-level social and ecological change. It attempts to overcome the limitations of many political-ecological theories of justice centered on notions of 'right order', 'fairness', 'distribution', and 'opportunities and capabilities', thereby successfully addressing the sociological and ecological vulnerabilities of the Virocene.","[Fernando, Jude L.] Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Int Dev & Social Change, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Fernando, JL (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Int Dev & Social Change, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jfernando@clarku.edu,,,,,,,,10,10,1,6,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

The current levels of consumption-based carbon footprints in all developed economies grossly exceed the sustainable level. Scientists have concluded that in addition to technological solutions, downscaling of consumption and far-reaching changes in lifestyles will be needed to achieve environmental sustainability. In this study, we provide a tangible real-world example that reveals the scale of the needed change from a perspective of a European welfare state citizen. Universal basic income (UBI) represents an income that is just enough to fulfil basic needs, such as food, shelter, and medication. In our case country, Finland, UBI is in practice at the same level as the income of the lowest income decile. The purpose of this study is to present and analyse the carbon footprints at a consumption level that corresponds to UBI. We compare the carbon footprints at this low-income level to average Finnish carbon footprints and discuss their sustainability in the light of global carbon budgets. We use an input-output approach based on the Finnish ENVIMAT model. The average carbon footprint at the UBI level is 4.8 tCO(2)-eq and it focuses on necessities. It's significantly lower than the average carbon footprint in Finland, 9.4 tCO(2)-eq, but still far from the level compatible with the current climate change mitigation targets. The results emphasize how challenging it is to find true low-carbon solutions for living in affluent countries.

J,"Zagonari, F",,,,"Zagonari, Fabio",,,Environmental sustainability is not worth pursuing unless it is achieved for ethical reasons,PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS; RESPONSIBILITY; EFFICIENCY; INSIGHTS,"This paper analytically characterizes the four main environmental sustainability paradigms (i.e., WS, weak sustainability; AG, a-growth; DG, de-growth; and SS, strong sustainability) by introducing uncertainty about future preferences for consumption and future technologies. SS represents an ethical approach because of its maximum aversion to inter-generational inequality of resources, whereas DG depicts preference changes, AG depicts technology changes, and WS represents the reference paradigm without accounting for preference or technology changes. By comparing the costs and benefits of these paradigms, solutions derived for the whole parameter domains based on data for a globally representative individual suggest that whenever environmental sustainability is pursued for welfare reasons within a utilitarian perspective (i.e., WS, AG, DG), it is not worth pursuing. In contrast, if environmental sustainability is achieved for ethical reasons within an egalitarian perspective (i.e., SS), it is worth pursuing, even with an increased world population. In terms of feasibility (i.e., whether there are realistic parameter values such that a given sustainability paradigm can achieve its goal), solutions are ranked ethics>preference>technology (i.e., SS>DG>AG), whereas WS is unfeasible. Thus, WS, AG, and DG are inconsistent sustainability paradigms, SS empirically solves the theoretical dispute on absolute rights, and environmental sustainability must be treated as an ethical issue. A conceptual discussion about environmental ethics and a statistical analysis based on panel data at a country level support the same insights. In terms of reliability (i.e., whether there are national policies or international agreements which can support a feasible sustainability paradigm), SS could be enforced by a global environmental agreement, supported by 66/55% of governments (i.e., top-down approach) and by 56/51% of citizens (i.e., bottom-up approach), in the most certain/uncertain scenarios, respectively.","[Zagonari, Fabio] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Qualita Vita, Cso Augusto 237, I-47921 Rimini, Italy",University of Bologna,"Zagonari, F (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Qualita Vita, Cso Augusto 237, I-47921 Rimini, Italy.",fabio.zagonari@unibo.it,,,,,,,,8,8,0,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",,,,PALGR COMMUN,Palgr.

A global overshoot in resource consumption suggests we are at a dramatic turning point in human history, the end of the era of constant 'wealth' expansion and the beginning of an era of severe limits and scarcity. This has profound implications for critical social thought, and for addressing current social problems. Recognizing limits will influence the form that a sustainable and just society must take, and transitions to it. Radical and large scale 'de-growth' involves localized, cooperative, frugal, self-sufficient and self-governing lifestyles, settlements and systems. Key elements in the required 'Simpler Way' are discussed as workable and attractive. More importantly, the article argues that these transitions are non-negotiable; no alternative can resolve the predicament of limits. There are important implications for transition theory and practice. Social theory will pursue new directions in this context, with greater convergence around support for an Anarchist perspective on social goals and means.","[Trainer, Ted] Pigface Point, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Trainer, Ted] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Trainer, T (corresponding author), Pigface Point, Kensington, NSW, Australia.;Trainer, T (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",tedtrainertsw@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10,10,2,5,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Herein, we have synthesized accordion-like multilayered titanium carbide MXenes (m-Ti3C2Tx) via a singlestep HF etching method from titanium aluminum carbide (Ti3AlC2). We demonstrate that the as-grown m-Ti3C2Tx acts as an efficient catalyst for dye degradation through a Fenton reaction in water without requiring any heterostructure due to the presence of a large amount of low-valence Ti states (Ti2+ and Ti3+). Postgrowth annealing studies establish the critical roles of Ti2+ and Ti3+ species of m-Ti3C2Tx in dye degradation. Our quantitative analysis reveals a direct correlation between the catalytic efficiency of mTi(3)C(2)T(x) MXene and its Ti2+ content. Under optimum experimental conditions, the degradation efficiency of 100% was achieved from 50 mL of 20 mu M concentration methylene blue (MB) solution within 24 min without the need for light illumination. The effect of MB concentration and pH of solutions on the degradation efficiency was investigated, and excellent degradation efficiency was found in acidic as well as basic media, which is significant. Furthermore, the free radical scavenging test indicates that center dot OH radicals are the main active species involved in this degradation process. We also explored the effect of the nature of dyes on the catalytic degradation efficiency, which reveals that the cationic dye (e.g., rhodamine B) has much higher degradation efficiency than the anionic dye (e.g., methyl orange). This work paves the way for the direct use of 2D MXenes for efficient catalysis without requiring any heterostructure or light illumination, and it provides significant insights for the practical application of m-Ti3C2Tx for polluted water treatment through an advanced oxidation process.","[Ghosh, Koushik; Ghosh, Joydip; Giri, P.

Craving for materialistic things and buying sprees for newer products indicate the dominant roles of human behavior in imminent ecological, social, and economic crises. However, existing global environmental governance has failed to address the current consumption patterns, particularly in rich countries. There is no inclusive developmental policy that integrates human behavior intervention to reduce unnecessary consumption, closed-loop material flow systems to keep waste out of the system, and economic strategies addressing ecological disaster from a social equity standpoint. The paper is based on a critical literature review of three concepts, relevance of behavioral economics in pro-environmental decision making, scope and limitations of circular economy as technological solutions, and conflicts of ecolog-ical economics with dominant neoclassical economics pitting 'degrowth' as an alternative. The paper proposes a theoretical concept of a novel economic model (minimalonomics) that aims to provide an institutional framework for a minimalist lifestyle without compromising wellbeing, prosperity, equity, and justice. The model focuses on minimizing consumption at the individual and societal levels, integrating theories and principles of ecological economics and behavioral economics, and efficient application of circular economy. Minimalonomics emphasizes creating a pro-environmental attitude in all levels of society (producers, consumers, and government) and translating the individual's perspective to collective and coordinated action for protecting the biosphere. Contrary to the standard economic approach, minimalonomics restores the value of localization and appropriates local social and cultural norms regarding consumption, waste reduction, and environmental protection; thus, the model is more inclusive. Minimalonomics is a novel concept; therefore, before application to governance and policies, it needs further research on creating theories, developing indicators, and testing them in the field.","[Sarkar, Atanu] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Fac Med, Div Community Hlth & Humanities, St John, NF, Canada; [Sarkar, Atanu] Mem Univ Newfoundland, M4M110 Hlth Sci Ctr, St John, NF A1B 3V6, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Sarkar, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, M4M110 Hlth Sci Ctr, St John, NF A1B 3V6, Canada.",atanu.sarkar@med.mun.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,10,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

In doing so, it has laid bare the limits of humanity's power over nature, exposing the vulnerability of 'normal' ways of living and their moral and pragmatic bankruptcy in coping with those vulnerabilities. 'Normal' is powerless against the virus and has not worked for a majority of the world's human and non-human population. Whatever new normal humanity fashions depends on the socio-ecological change set in motion by mutations between human and non-human species. The outcomes of society's responses to the pandemic depend on how human agency, as an embodiment of social, ecological, and metaphysical relations, transforms the relations now shaped by capitalism and racism-the two mutually reinforcing processes at the root of the Virocene's social and ecological vulnerabilities. A deeper understanding of vulnerabilities is necessary to avoid recreating a 'new normal' that normalizes the current oppressive and vulnerable social order, while inhibiting our ability to transform the world. At the same time, the sweeping possibilities of alternative ways of organizing humanity's mutual wellbeing and nature lie at our fingertips. The emancipatory political consciousness, rationalities, and strategies inherent in such intuitively sensible and counter-hegemonic approaches, first and foremost, are matters of justice, embodied in the power that shapes human-nature metabolism. The Virocene is thus a battleground for social and ecological justice. To be effective partners in these struggles for justice, political ecology needs a universal perspective of social and ecological justice that functions both as a form of critical inquiry-that is, as a way to understand how social and ecological inequalities and justices arise and function-and as a form of critical praxis-that is, as a way to reclaim and transform capitalism and racism's power in valuing and organizing social and ecological wellbeing.","[Fernando, Jude L.] Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Int Dev & Social Change, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Fernando, JL (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev Community & Environm, Int Dev & Social Change, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jfernando@clarku.edu,,,,,,,,18,18,0,8,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Why and how did we arrive at this point? This paper argues that, conceiving each individual human as one cell in the greater human body, we are afflicted by what John McMurtry termed 'the cancer stage of capitalism.' This provocative framing is adopted here in response to growing calls by climate, earth and physical scientists not to 'mince words' in the description and analysis of humanity's current predicament, but rather 'tell it like it is.' Methods: Proceeding from McMurtry's application of the seven defining medical properties of a 'cancer invasion [of] an individual organism' to the broader body politic and the earth's life system, this paper draws on literature from diverse disciplines to investigate the fundamental cause of food systems crises. The paper references several empirical studies and meta-reviews that indicate the hastening decline in the integrity of human and ecological health, with a particular focus on the grain-oilseed-livestock complex and the accompanying social and ecological impacts on the southern cone countries of South America. Results: The cause of food system crises is to be found in the core logic of capital accumulation, the profit imperative, and the relentless and expanding processes of commodification and financialization. The key metric of 'economic growth' is problematised and discussed. An embryonic 'social immune response' is now observable, in the diverse practices of decommodification, proposals for de-growth and commoning that together constitute an emerging 'food as a commons' movement. Conclusion: As currently framed, the Food as Commons proposal lacks coherence, rigour and a viable strategy to move beyond the current crisis. Its transformative potential can be strengthened through a more explicitly political grounding based on appeals to and support of anti-and post-capitalist movements and initiatives.","[Rose, Nick] William Angliss Inst, Fac Higher Educ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Rose, N (corresponding author), William Angliss Inst, Fac Higher Educ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",nick.rose@angliss.edu.au,,,,,,,,2,2,2,5,KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES,KERMAN,"JAHAD BLVD, KERMAN, 7619813159, IRAN",,,,INT J HEALTH POLICY,Int.

However, the applications of p-GaN are often limited by the low hole concentration and high resistivity. Until now, only Mg has been successfully employed as an effective and practical acceptor impurity in GaN for achieving useful p-type conduction. Post-growth treatment, such as thermal annealing, is required to activate the Mg acceptors in GaN in case of layers grown via metal -organic chemical vapor deposition ( MOCVD). Further, there is convincing evidence that hydrogen passivates Mg acceptors in the as-grown state of the materials. An appropriate Mg doping concentration is required for obtaining high-quality GaN. The usage of a considerably high or low Mg doping concentration does not allow for a high hole concentration because of the selfcompensation effect associated with heavy Mg doping. In addition, the dislocation density and the concentration of unintentionally doped impurities (e. g., carbon and oxygen) have an important effect on the resistivity of p-GaN. Overall, the compensation mechanisms and functions of the p-doped GaN and AlGaN materials must be clarified for their further development. rods A series of Mg-doped p-GaN films was grown in a vertical MOCVD system under different growth temperatures. An Aixtron 3 x 2 MOCVD system was used for growing p-GaN films. A 20-nm thick GaN buffer layer was initially grown at 540 t on a sapphire substrate. Then, a 2-ttm thick unintentionally doped GaN layer was grown by increasing the temperature to 1060 t. Subsequently, a series of 0.7 -tan thick Mg-doped GaN layers was grown at 1000-1050 t. Each sample was annealed at 800 t for 3 min under the same nitrogen environment for activating the Mg acceptors. Trimethylgallium (TMGa), ammonia (NH3), and Cp2Mg were used as sources of Ga, N, and Mg, respectively, when using MOCVD. All the conditions were maintained constant for each sample (A E), except the growth temperature. X-ray diffraction was performed to confirm that the dislocation density in each sample was approximately identical. Further, the resistivity and hole concentration of each sample were measured using the room -temperature Hall method. In addition, the photoluminescence ( PL) was measured and secondary-ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS) was performed to study the compensation effect of the carbon impurities on p-GaN and its physical mechanism. Results and Discussions The results obtained from the room-temperature Hall method (Table 1) indicate that the hole concentration increased and the resistivity decreased with the increasing growth temperature. To find possible causes for these phenomena, room-temperature PL spectra ( Fig. 1) were obtained using a 325-nm laser beam excitation. The undulation of the PL spectral curves can be attributed to the interference caused by the Fabry-Perot effect owing to flat epitaxial films, which can be eliminated via a line-shape simulation treatment. Samples B, C, and D exhibited a blue luminescence (BL) band peak at approximately 430 nm (2. 8 eV), whereas samples A and B did not exhibit such a peak. Detailed investigations have proven that the 2. 8 -eV BL is caused by donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination, where a strong BL peak indicates a high density of DAPs. A considerably high Mg doping concentration may induce a high concentration of DAPs, which can decrease the hole concentration and increase the resistivity. However, in this study, samples B, C, and D exhibited a high BL intensity but not the highest resistivity, implying that factors other than the self-compensation of Mg resulted in the high resistivity of GaN grown at low temperatures. By performing SIMS on samples B, C, and D ( Fig. 2), we can observe that the carbon concentration in sample D was the lowest, implying that the concentration of carbon impurities considerably influences the resistivity of p-GaN by acting as a nonradiative recombination center and thereby decreasing the intensity of the BL band peak. Thus, the carbon impurities in p-GaN can form deep donors and compensate for the Mg acceptors, resulting in the deteriorated resistivity and poor mass of p-GaN. The experimental results presented in Table 2 indicate that the self-compensation effect of Mg in case of p-GaN growth was weaker at a lower growth temperature. However, a lower growth temperature can increase the density of carbon impurities, increasing the resistivity. Further, a higher growth temperature resulted in a stronger self-compensation effect and a lower carbon impurity concentration. The samples grown at high temperatures exhibited low resistivity despite the enhanced selfcompensation effect of the Mg impurities, indicating that the compensation of carbon impurities played a more important role in p-GaN. Therefore, carbon impurities must be suppressed to obtain p-GaN materials with low resistivity and high hole concentrations. The p-GaN samples grown at high temperatures were of high quality because of their low concentrations of carbon impurities. High-quality p-GaN conduction layers are required for the growth of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well optoelectronic devices. However, tradeoffs must be considered because the growth temperature of the top p -type GaN layer must not be considerably high to avoid thermal instability and the decomposition of the InGaN layers. It must be considerably lower than 1050 t in a blue or green light-emitting device. Carbon impurities must be suppressed by regulating other growth conditions to obtain a high-quality p -type layer. Generally, the p-GaN layer in GaN/AlGaN multilayer devices must be grown at high temperatures. Conclusions The effect of the growth temperature of heavily Mg-doped p-GaN films is studied based on the SIMS and PL measurements as well as the Hall method. Experimental results show that the self-compensation of the Mg impurity in p-GaN increased with the increasing growth temperature; however, its resistivity decreased. Further study indicated that the concentration of carbon impurity in the p-GaN sample grown at high temperatures was low. Carbon impurities can compensate for the Mg acceptor and increase the resistivity. The presented results indicate that the compensation of carbon impurities plays a more important role in the development of p-GaN films than the self-compensation of Mg.

To adequately account for this opposite development in public cost-benefit analyses, it has been proposed-based on a two-goods extension of the Ramsey growth model-to apply good-specific discount rates for manufactured consumption goods and for ecosystem services. Using empirical data for ten ecosystem services across five countries and the world at large, we estimated the difference between the discount rates for ecosystem services and for manufactured consumption goods. In a conservative estimate, we found that ecosystem services in all countries should be discounted at rates that are significantly lower than the ones for manufactured consumption goods. On global average, ecosystem services should be discounted at a rate that is 0.9 0.3 %-points lower than the one for manufactured consumption goods. The difference is larger in less developed countries and smaller in more developed countries. This result supports and substantiates the suggestion that public cost-benefit-analyses should use country-specific dual discount rates-one for manufactured consumption goods and one for ecosystem services.","[Baumgaertner, Stefan; Thiel, Denise; Winkler, Klara] Univ Luneburg, Sustainabil Econ Grp, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Klein, Alexandra M.] Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Klein, Alexandra M.] Univ Freiburg, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Thiel, Denise] Univ Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Winkler, Klara] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Freiburg; Lund University,"Baumgartner, S (corresponding author), Univ Luneburg, Sustainabil Econ Grp, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",baumgaertner@uni.leuphana.de,,,,,,,,32,32,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

EVs require important amounts of materials, some of which are being assessed as potentially critical in the future. In this work, we develop a submodule of material requirements for transport for an integrated assessment model with great detail in the representation of electric transportation modes. This submodule includes the following novel characteristics: a portfolio of EV battery subtechnologies (LMO, NMC622, NMC811, NCA & LFP) and EV chargers, including the required connections to the grid; comprehensive coverage of their material intensities; and a dynamic allocation function for EV battery subtechnologies, taking into account the changes over time of their Energy Stored Over energy Invested (ESOI) and material scarcities. We obtain ESOIst levels for household 4-wheelers in the range of 1.1-2.3 : 1 depending on the subtechnology, and lower than 1 : 1 for all subtechnologies when expanding the boundaries (ESOIfinal) to include grids and chargers. The NCA and NMC subtechnologies are the best performing options in terms of ESOI; however, they are more dependent on critical materials such as nickel, cobalt and manganese. Expanding the boundaries to include chargers significantly increases the GHG footprint of EVs. The integration of these features into a dynamic modelling framework, including the demand of materials from the rest of the economy, allows us to analyse different decarbonisation strategies, taking into account the feedback between the energy and material dimensions. Simulating the MEDEAS-World model including the developed submodule until 2050 for 3 different global transport transition strategies, we find that reserves of copper (with significant contributions from EV chargers and railways), cobalt, lithium, manganese, nickel and graphite would be depleted in at least one of the scenarios studied. The Degrowth scenario puts less pressure on material endowments. Recycling is an important strategy to reduce criticalities, but its effectiveness is limited as the materials are trapped for long time periods in stocks in-use in the system, which is worsened by the growth-oriented nature of the current economic paradigm.","[Pulido-Sanchez, Daniel; Capellan-Perez, Inigo; de Castro, Carlos; Frechoso, Fernando] Univ Valladolid, Escuela Ingn Ind, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Paseo Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [Capellan-Perez, Inigo] Univ Valladolid, Dept Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [de Castro, Carlos] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Phys, Escuela Ingn Ind, Sede Mergelina 511,C Dr Mergelina S-N, Valladoliii 47011, Spain; [Frechoso, Fernando] Univ Valladolid, Dept Elect Engn, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Del Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Escuela Ingn Ind, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Paseo Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain.;Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, Valladolid 47011, Spain.",inigo.capellan@uva.es,,,"European Union [821105]; MODESLOW (Modeling and Simulation of scenarios towards a LOW-carbon transition: The Spanish case), a Spanish national research project under the Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Program (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [ECO2017-85110-R]; Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [IJC2020-046215-I]","European Union(European Commission); MODESLOW (Modeling and Simulation of scenarios towards a LOW-carbon transition: The Spanish case), a Spanish national research project under the Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Program (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain; Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain","This work has been partially developed under the LOCOMOTION project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 821105.

Landscape pattern metrics were estimated in order to reveal the change in habitats and present the properties of the landscape. 30 pattern indicators on class and pattern levels, which are important to show human-environment interaction, were analyzed in order to indicate the features of the landscape such as area, side, shape and dispersion. To this end, LANDSAT TM/7-ETM/8-OLI satellite images of 1987 and 2013 were classified for laying the foundations of the analysis. Analyses showed that between 1987 and 2013, complicated shape features, increase in edge habitats, de-growth in core areas and eventually fragmentation in landscape have been dominant. Heterogenic structure in landscape has increased. This points not to the self-functioning of the landscape, but to the domination of human intervention over the landscape. Particularly, due to urban growth and sprawl, fragmentation, isolation and habitat loss in croplands have increased.

The period of the analysis spanned 2000 to 2014, and the full period was divided into two halves: before the 2008 global financial crisis and after it. Our empirical model was based on the system generalized method of moments model, and 264 construction companies were used as the study sample. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. (1) A profitability-driven management strategy limits company growth, thus prolonging the economic downturn; (2) When the macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, high growth in the previous period fosters profitability in the current period. This implies that the phenomenon of dynamic increasing returns is present in the Korean construction industry, and learning through growth enhances productivity and profitability. Consequentially, a strategy oriented towards short-term profitability (popular with small- and medium-sized Korean construction companies) makes the corporate management less resilient, causing them to select de-growth during the long-term stagnation by decreasing their scale of operations. Accordingly, it is important for companies to maintain the balance between growth and profitability.","[Yoo, Seungkyu; Kim, Jaejun] Hanynag Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Hanynag Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 222 Wangsipri Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",james_yoo@hotmail.com; jjkim@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,,10,10,5,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2015,7,12,,,,,15982,15998,,10.3390/su71215796,0,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DA1JA,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-02,WOS:000367550900014,0,en

Given the rapid rise in transport in industrializing countries, particularly China and India, this fraction is expected to increase in the coming decades. In the context of the need to reduce transport energy and GHG emissions, this paper addresses the following question: Should most of our efforts to reduce transport energy use and GHG emissions concentrate on reducing emissions (or energy) per unit of transport task (e.g. kg CO2-equivalent per passenger-km), or should we rather focus on reducing the passenger transport task itself? In addressing this question we limit our examination to surface passenger transport, since this makes up a significant proportion of all transport GHG emissions. We show by consideration of the available literature that it is most unlikely that technical solutions alone can deliver anywhere near the reductions needed. We then examine proposed non-technical solutions and conclude that major transport policy changes that reduce passenger travel levels themselves will be most effective in producing timely and deep transport emission cuts in existing economies. We end by discussing the prospect for these approaches in the transport sector and the broader economic consequences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This conclusion seems to alleviate concerns over resource scarcity and limits to growth, and feeds optimism for green growth and sustainability prospects. However, the validity of GDP as the sole and unambiguous measure of the ultimate outcome of the economy has been severely disputed. There is nowadays increasing interest in broader welfare measurements that capture more aspects of economic output and hence constitute better approximations of well-being. The present paper provides an overview of the above discussion and sets out to explore the relevance of three alternative welfare indicators - the Human Development Index (HDI), the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) - as a basis for evaluating the dependency of welfare and its major engine, the economy, on natural resources. Increasing welfare appears to require a disproportionate use of resources. Strong and increasing dependency on resources at the global level and in giant countries such as China and India may have serious implications for current sustainability policies and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","[Kalimeris, Panos; Bithas, Kostas; Richardson, Clive] Panteion Univ, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Inst Urban Environm & Human Resources, 29 Aristotelous St, GR-17671 Athens, Greece; [Kalimeris, Panos] Publ Power Corp SA PPC, Support Operat Div, Dept Mat & Purchasing, 55 Stournari St, GR-10432 Athens, Greece; [Bithas, Kostas] Michigan Stare Univ, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, Manly Miles Bldg,1405 South Harrison Rd, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Panteion University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kalimeris, P (corresponding author), Panteion Univ, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Inst Urban Environm & Human Resources, 29 Aristotelous St, GR-17671 Athens, Greece.;Kalimeris, P (corresponding author), Publ Power Corp SA PPC, Support Operat Div, Dept Mat & Purchasing, 55 Stournari St, GR-10432 Athens, Greece.",pkalimeris@eesd.gr,,,,,,,,28,29,8,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Their synthesis includes the incorporation of an ethynyl fragment by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, with the goal of extending the conjugation and consequently redshifting their emission wavelength. Different regioisomers, substituted in the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the phenolate side of the HBO core, were studied in order to compare their photophysical properties. The complexes were characterized by X-ray diffraction and NMR, UV/Vis, and emission spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state. In all cases, complexation to boron leads to a donoracceptor character that impacts their photophysical properties. Complexes with a 3- or 5-substituted fragment display mild to pronounced internal charge transfer (ICT), a feature strengthened by the presence of p-dibutylaminophenylacetylene in the molecular structure, protonation of the nitrogen atom of which leads to a significant blueshift and an increase in quantum yield. On the contrary, when the ethynyl module is grafted on the 4-position, narrow, structured, symmetrical absorption/emission bands are observed. Moreover, the fact that protonation has little effect on the emission maximum wavelength reveals singlet excited-state decay. Solid-state emission properties reveal a redshift compared to solution, explained by tight packing of the -conjugated systems and the high planarity of the dyes. Subsequent connection of these complexes to other photoactive subunits (BODIPY, Boranil) provides dyads in which efficient cascade energy transfer is observed. Cet article presente une serie de treize complexes de bore tetraedriques luminescents bases sur le motif 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HBO). Leur synthese comprend l'incorporation d'un fragment ethynyle par une reaction de couplage croise de Sonogashira dans le but d'etendre la conjugaison et ainsi deplacer leur longueur d'onde d'emission dans le rouge (basses longueur d'onde). Differents regioisomeres, substitues en position 3, 4 ou 5 du cote phenol du groupement HBO ont ete etudies afin de comparer leurs proprietes spectroscopiques. Les complexes ont ete caracterises par RMN, diffraction des rayons X sur mono-crystal, spectroscopie UV-Visible et emission a la fois en solution et a l'etat solide. Pour chaque compose, la complexation au bore entraine un caractere donneur-accepteur de la molecule, ce va qui fortement influer sur les proprietes photophysiques. Les complexes fonctionnalises en position 3 et 5 presentent un transfert de charge interne (TCI) qui est amplifie par la presence du groupement dibutylaminophenylacetylene dans la structure des molecules; la protonation de l'atome d'azote par de l'HCl gazeux entraine un deplacement de la longueur d'onde d'emission vers le bleu (longueur d'onde plus elevee) et une augmentation du rendement quantique. A l'oppose, lorsque l'espaceur ethynyle est greffe en position 4, des bandes d'absorption/emission etroites, structurees et symetriques sont observees. Par ailleurs, la protonation n'a que peu d'effet sur le maximum de la longueur d'onde d'emission, mettant en evidence une decroissance de l'etat excite de type singulet. L'etude des proprietes d'emission a l'etat solide revelent un deplacement vers le rouge en comparaison des proprietes en solution, qui est explique par les empilements importants des systemes conjugues et la grande planeite des colorants.

Despite the passage of international agreements calling for these issues to be addressed simultaneously, little is known about the direct relationship between them. This study addresses this gap by proposing a new and composite indicator that integrates measures for both poverty and environmental outcomes (carbon emissions) into a single variable, the carbon intensity of poverty reduction (CIPR). This variable defines the trade-off between the proportional changes of emissions per capita and of the share of the population above the poverty line. In parallel an analytic framework is developed to formulate propositions concerning the possible effects of growth and inequality on the CIPR. The propositions are tested empirically using data from 135 countries across a 30-year time period (1981-2012). The findings confirm that the carbon intensity of poverty reduction is heterogeneous across countries. This heterogeneity is partly explained by economic growth, which is found to have a negative effect on the CIPR up to a certain income level, defined here as a turning point. Above that turning point, economic growth increases the CIPR. By contrast, inequality reduction is shown to have a significant negative effect on the CIPR. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable development by analytically and quantitatively linking its three dimensions (social, economic and environmental) and by employing a composite indicator that directly measures the trade-off between poverty reduction and emission levels across countries.","[Malerba, Daniele] DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Malerba, Daniele] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester,"Malerba, D (corresponding author), DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.;Malerba, D (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",daniele.malerba@die-gdi.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).,,,8,8,2,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

J,"Kopnina, H",,,,"Kopnina, Helen",,,Green-washing or best case practices? Using circular economy and Cradle to Cradle case studies in business education,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Circular economy; Cradle to Cradle; Education for sustainability; Sustainable production,DESIGN; SUSTAINABILITY; EMISSIONS; PRODUCT; IF,"Closed loop or 'circular' production systems known as Circular Economy and Cradle to Cradle represent a unique opportunity to radically revise the currently wasteful system of production. One of the challenges of such systems is that circular products need to be both produced locally with minimum environmental footprint and simultaneously satisfy demand of global consumers. This article presents a literature review that describes the application of circular methodologies to education for sustainability, which has been slow to adopt circular systems to the curriculum. This article discusses how Bachelor and Masterlevel students apply their understanding of these frameworks to corporate case studies. Two assignment-related case studies are summarized, both of which analyze products that claim to be 'circular'. The students' research shows that the first case, which describes the impact of a hybrid material soda bottle, does not meet circularity criteria. The second case study, which describes products and applications of a mushroom-based material, is more sustainable. However, the students' research shows that the manufacturers have omitted transport from the environmental impact assessment and therefore the mushroom materials may not be as sustainable as the manufacturers claim. As these particular examples showed students how green advertising can be misleading, applying ideal circularity principles as part of experiential learning could strengthen the curriculum. Additionally, this article recommends that sustainable business curriculum should also focus on de-growth and steady-state economy, with these radical alternatives to production becoming a central focus of education of responsible citizens.

Eclogite facies metamorphism of mafic and ultramafic rocks records the subduction of the Gondwana hyperextended margin. Part of these eclogites are forming boudins-enclaves in felsic HP granulite facies migmatites partly retrogressed into amphibolite facies attesting for continental subduction followed by thermal relaxation and decompression. We propose that HP partial melting has triggered mechanical decoupling of the partially molten continental rocks from the subducting slab. This would have allowed buoyancy-driven exhumation and entrainment of pieces of oceanic lithosphere and subcontinental mantle. Geochronological data of the eclogite-bearing HP migmatites points to diachronous emplacement of distinct nappes from middle to late Devonian. These nappes were thrusted onto metapelites and orthogneisses affected by MP/MT greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism reaching partial melting attributed to the late Devonian to early Carboniferous thickening of the crust. The emplacement of laccoliths rooted into strike-slip transcurrent shear zones capped by low-angle detachments from c.345 to c.310Ma is concomitant with the southward propagation of the Variscan deformation front marked by deposition of clastic sediments in foreland basins. We attribute these features to horizontal growth of the Variscan belt and formation of an orogenic plateau by gravity-driven lateral flow of the partially molten orogenic root. The diversity of the magmatic rocks points to various crustal sources with modest, but systematic mantle-derived input. In the eastern French Massif Central, the southward decrease in age of the mantle- and crustal-derived plutonic rocks from c.345Ma to c.310Ma suggests southward retreat of a northward subducting slab toward the Paleotethys free boundary. Late Carboniferous destruction of the Variscan belt is dominantly achieved by gravitational collapse accommodated by the activation of low-angle detachments and the exhumation-crystallization of the partially molten orogenic root forming crustal-scale LP migmatite domes from c.305Ma to c.295Ma, coeval with orogen-parallel flow in the external zone. Laccoliths emplaced along low-angle detachments and intrusive dykes with sharp contacts correspond to the segregation of the last melt fraction leaving behind a thick accumulation of refractory LP felsic and mafic granulites in the lower crust. This model points to the primordial role of partial melting and magmatism in the tectonic-geodynamic evolution of the Variscan orogenic belt. In particular, partial melting and magma transfer (i) triggers mechanical decoupling of subducted units from the downgoing slab and their syn-orogenic exhumation; (ii) the development of an orogenic plateau by lateral flow of the low-viscosity partially molten crust; and, (iii) the formation of metamorphic core complexes and domes that accommodate post-orogenic exhumation during gravitational collapse. All these processes contribute to differentiation and stabilisation of the orogenic crust. Nous presentons dans ce papier un modele geodynamique-tectonique pour la genese et le fluage des roches partiellement fondues et le magmatisme au cours de l'evolution orogenique Varisque du Silurien au Carbonifere superieur base sur une synthese des donnees geologiques du Massif Central Francais. La subduction de la marge du Gondwana hyper-etiree est enregistre par des roches mafiques et ultramafiques affectees par un metamorphisme en facies eclogitique. Ces eclogites forment pour certaines des boudins-enclaves dans des migmatites felsiques avec des reliques de facies granulitique de HP retrogradees en facies amphibolitique, ce qui atteste de la subduction de la marge continentale suivie d'une relaxation thermique et d'une decompression. Nous proposons que la fusion partielle a HP ait declenche le decouplage mecanique entre la plaque plongeante et les unites continentales partiellement fondues. Ceci a permis l'exhumation de ces roches gravitairement instables qui ont entraine sur leur passage des blocs de lithosphere oceanique et de manteau sous-continental. Les donnees geochronologiques disponibles sur les migmatites de HP contenant des eclogites indique une mise en place diachronique de nappes du Devonien moyen au Devonien Superieur. Ces nappes ont chevauche un assemblage de metapelites et d'orthogneiss affectees par un metamorphisme de MP/MT allant du facies schistes verts a amphibolite atteignant localement la fusion partielle et attribue a l'epaississement crustal du Devonien superieur au Carbonifere moyen. La mise en place de laccolithes enracines dans des zones de cisaillement decrochantes et surmontes de detachements a faible pendage de c. 345 a c.310Ma est synchrone de la propagation vers le Sud du front de deformation Varisque marque par le depot de sediments detritiques dans les bassins d'avant-pays. Nous attribuons ces elements a la croissance horizontale de la ceinture Varisque associee a la formation d'un plateau orogenique par fluage lateral de la racine orogenique partiellement fondue sous l'effet de la force gravitaire. La diversite des roches magmatiques temoigne d'une variete des sources crustales avec une contribution relativement modeste mais systematique de magmas issus du manteau. Dans la partie Est du Massif Central Francais, la decroissance vers le Sud des ages de mise en place des magmas derives a la fois du manteau et de la croute suggere le retrait d'un panneau plongeant vers le Nord vers la bordure libre constituee par la Paleotethys et situee au Sud de la ceinture Varisque. La destruction de la chaine Varisque a la fin du Carbonifere est principalement le resultat de l'effondrement gravitaire accommode par l'activation de detachements a faible pendage et l'exhumation-cristallisation de la racine orogenique partiellement fondue formant des domes d'echelle crustale a c oe ur de migmatites de BP entre c.305 et 295Ma, concomitante au fluage lateral des unites de la zone externe de la chaine. Les derniers magmas extraits de la zone de fusion partielle forment des dykes et des laccolithes mis en place dans des detachements a faible pendage laissant derriere eux une croute inferieure constituee de l'accumulation de granulites refractaires de composition felsique a mafique. Ce modele met en valeur le role primordial de la fusion partielle et du magmatisme sur l'evolution tectonique-geodynamique de la ceinture orogenique Varisque. En particulier, la fusion partielle et le transfert de magma (i) declenchent le decouplage mecanique entre le panneau plongeant et les unites subductees, permettant ainsi l'exhumation de ces dernieres, (ii) favorisent le developpement d'un plateau orogenique par fluage lateral de la croute partiellement fondue de faible viscosite sous l'effet de la gravite, (iii) conduisent a la formation de metamorphic core complex et de domes qui accommodent l'exhumation post-orogenique au cours de l'effondrement gravitaire de la chaine. Tous ces processus contribuent a la differenciation et a la stabilisation de la croute orogenique.","[Vanderhaeghe, Olivier; Laurent, Oscar] IRD, CNRS, UPS, GET, 14 Ave E Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Laurent, Oscar; Chelle-Michou, Cyril] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geochem & Petr, Clausiusstr 25, CH-8038 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gardien, Veronique] Univ Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, CNRS, LGL TPE,UMR 5276, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Moyen, Jean-Francois; Couzinie, Simon] Univ Lyon, Lab Magmas & Volcans, UJM UCA CNRS IRD, 23 Rue Dr Paul Michelon, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Gebelin, Aude] Plymouth Univ, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Couzinie, Simon] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, CRPG, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Villaros, Arnaud] Univ Orleans, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Villaros, Arnaud] CNRS, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Villaros, Arnaud] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, ISTO, UMR 7327, BP 36009, F-45060 Orleans, France; [Villaros, Arnaud] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Earth Sci, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Bellanger, Mathieu] TLS Geotherm, 91 Chemin Gabardie, F-31200 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; University of Plymouth; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Stellenbosch University,"Vanderhaeghe, O (corresponding author), IRD, CNRS, UPS, GET, 14 Ave E Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",Olivier.vanderhaeghe@get.omp.eu,,,French geological mapping program; BRGM; Labex VOLTAIRE [ANR-10-LABX-100-01]; INSU,French geological mapping program; BRGM(Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM)); Labex VOLTAIRE; INSU(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)),"This paper results from a long gestation process.

Whereas much has been written on the economic weakness of a model heavily based on the construction industry, little attention has been given to the internal regulations, policies, social and cultural factors in which the Spanish urban growth model was embedded. The question insufficiently addressed by current debates is therefore: to what extent is Spain's current crisis the result of its urban economic and social growth model? In this essay I argue that the crisis in the Spanish urban growth model reveals a particular interaction of globalizing forces with national and local processes, characterized both by specific structures of economic incentives and path-dependent cultural traits. The combination of these factors goes some way towards an explanation of the housing bubble. This specific combination of factors, however, makes the outlook for the aftermath of the housing bubble in Spain different from that experienced in the United States. Resume La crise mondiale actuelle a fortement affecte l'Espagne, mais ce qui se passe aujourd'hui tient au recent modele de croissance economique et urbaine. Alors qu'on a beaucoup ecrit sur la faiblesse economique d'un modele fonde largement sur le secteur du batiment, on ne s'est guere interesse aux reglementations internes, politiques publiques ou facteurs socio-culturels dans lesquels s'inscrit le modele de croissance urbaine espagnole. La question que les debats actuels n'abordent que trop peu est donc : dans quelle mesure la crise que connait l'Espagne resulte-t-elle de son modele de croissance socio-economique urbaine? Il est affirme ici que la crise de ce modele revele une interaction particuliere des forces mondialisatrices avec les processus nationaux et locaux, caracterises les uns comme les autres par des structures specifiques d'incitations economiques et par des traits culturels tributaires de chemins de dependance. La combinaison de ces facteurs participe a une explication de la bulle du logement. Concernant ce phenomene, l'association specifique des facteurs etudies permet d'envisager des repercussions differentes pour l'Espagne comparee aux Etats-Unis.","[Garcia, Marisol] Univ Barcelona, Dept Sociol Theory, Fac Econ & Business, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Garcia, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Sociol Theory, Fac Econ & Business, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",marisolgarcia@ub.edu,,,,,,,,165,168,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

Additionally, isolates were tested physiologically in order to support Monilinia segregation. However, no significant differences were found among the isolates for optimum growth temperature and lesion size of inoculated pear fruit.

This article demonstrates, with location quotient and hot-spot analyses, the unevenness of general dentist and dental specialist resources throughout the Canadian province of Ontario and the presence of dental clusters within the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Windsor. While many municipalities in the province have no or relatively few dental offices, municipalities that are comparatively rich in both general and specialized dentists are rare and tend to be part of larger urban environments (typically census metropolitan areas), characterized by higher growth rates, higher median incomes, and lower median ages. Dentist office hot-spots within metropolitan areas occur in or near the downtown and in more peripheral/suburban locales. High sales dentist offices in suburban hot-spots appear to benefit from prosperous locations and supply deficits nearby, whereas inner-city dentist districts may form in part because of localization economies. Understanding where relative dentist under-supply occurs within a jurisdiction and why other locations are dentist-rich is important from a policy perspective so that geographic inequities, and associated spatial accessibility issues, can be more comprehensively appraised. Resume Les profils geographiques des dentistes ont fait l'objet d'etudes qui, pour la plupart, se limitent a des evaluations sommaires.

Sex ratio also has particularly important implications for growth rates of many large mammal populations through its influence on reproductive potential. Therefore, the interrelationships between density-dependent factors, comprising density, sex ratio and underlying growth rates (r) were examined for the Eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli) living in three rhino sanctuaries in Kenya using four population models. The exponential and logistic models gave similar results and the former were accepted because they better portrayed the actual situation on the ground. Sex ratios in all sanctuary populations were positively correlated with r but interpreted with realization of other factors also affecting r. We caution that the results of population models should be interpreted alongside ground-truthed observations. We recommend that future translocation strategies should take into account sex and age structures of the donor population, while future studies of density dependence should take into account both biotic and abiotic factors.Resume Des mecanismes de feedback de densite-dependance chez les grands herbivores donnent un apercu de la dynamique des populations et de l'interaction avec l'ecosysteme. Les sex-ratios ont aussi d'importantes implications pour la dynamique des populations de nombreux grands mammiferes, specialement par leur influence sur le potentiel reproducteur. On a etudie ces relations croisees entre les facteurs densite-dependants du rhino noir de l'Est Diceros bicornis michaeli, le sex-ratio et le taux de croissance (r) sous-jacent dans trois sanctuaires de rhinos du Kenya en utilisant quatre modeles de population. Les modeles exponentiel et logistique donnaient des resultats similaires, les resultats du premier etant acceptes parce qu'ils representaient la situation actuelle sur le terrain. Les sex-ratios de toutes les populations etaient positivement lies ar mais interpretes en realisant que d'autres facteurs affectent aussi r. Nous attirons l'attention sur le fait que les resultats de la modelisation des populations doivent etre interpretes tout en les confirmant par des observations sur le terrain; nous recommandons des strategies de translocations qui prelevent des individus dans les diverses structures de sexe et d'age de la population d'origine; et nous suggerons que de futures etudes de densite-dependance tiennent compte de facteurs biotiques et abiotiques.","[Okita-Ouma, Benson] Kenya Wildlife Serv, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Okita-Ouma, Benson; Amin, Rajan] Zool Soc London, London NW1 4RY, England; [Okita-Ouma, Benson; Leader-Williams, Nigel] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England; [Okita-Ouma, Benson; van Langevelde, Frank] Wageningen Univ, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Zoological Society of London; University of Kent; Wageningen University & Research,"Okita-Ouma, B (corresponding author), Kenya Wildlife Serv, POB 40241, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",bokita@kws.go.ke,,,African Wildlife Foundation; DEFRA's Darwin Initiative for the Survival of Species; DICE at the University of Kent; IUCN-SSC-African Rhino Specialist Group; Kenya Wildlife Service; North of England Zoological Society (Chester Zoo); Save the Rhino International; United States Agency for International Development; US-Fish and Wildlife's Rhino and Tiger Fund; Zoological Society of London,African Wildlife Foundation; DEFRA's Darwin Initiative for the Survival of Species; DICE at the University of Kent; IUCN-SSC-African Rhino Specialist Group; Kenya Wildlife Service; North of England Zoological Society (Chester Zoo); Save the Rhino International; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); US-Fish and Wildlife's Rhino and Tiger Fund; Zoological Society of London,"This study was made possible through funding from African Wildlife Foundation, DEFRA's Darwin Initiative for the Survival of Species; DICE at the University of Kent; IUCN-SSC-African Rhino Specialist Group; Kenya Wildlife Service, North of England Zoological Society (Chester Zoo), Save the Rhino International, United States Agency for International Development, US-Fish and Wildlife's Rhino and Tiger Fund, and Zoological Society of London.

Recent advances in understanding the biology of hair have accelerated the research and development of novel therapeutic and cosmetic hair growth agents. Preclinical models aid in dermocosmetic efficacy testing and claim substantiation of hair growth modulators. The in vitro models to investigate hair growth utilize the hair follicle Dermal Papilla cells (DPCs), specialized mesenchymal cells located at the base of hair follicle that play essential roles in hair follicular morphogenesis and postnatal hair growth cycles. In this review, we have compiled and discussed the extensively reported literature citing DPCs as in vitro model to study hair growth promoting and inhibitory effects. A variety of agents such as herbal and natural extracts, growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma, placental extract, stem cells and conditioned medium, peptides, hormones, lipid-nanocarrier, light, electrical and electromagnetic field stimulation, androgens and their analogs, stress-serum and chemotherapeutic agents etc. have been examined for their hair growth modulating effects in DPCs. Effects on DPCs' activity were determined from untreated (basal) or stress induced levels. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and secretion of growth factors were included as primary end-point markers. Effects on a wide range of biomolecules and mechanistic pathways that play key role in the biology of hair growth were also investigated. This consolidated and comprehensive review summarizes the up-to-date information and understanding regarding DPCs based screening models for hair growth and may be helpful for researchers to select the appropriate assay system and biomarkers. This review highlights the pivotal role of DPCs in the forefront of hair research as screening platforms by providing insights into mechanistic action at cellular level, which may further direct the development of novel hair growth modulators. Les problemes capillaires, tels que la perte de cheveux (alopecie) et la croissance excessive des cheveux dependante des androgenes (hirsutisme, hypertrichose), peuvent avoir un impact sur le bien-etre social et psychologique de la personne. De recentes avancees dans la connaissance de la biologie des cheveux ont accelere la recherche et le developpement de nouveaux agents therapeutiques et cosmetiques pour la croissance des cheveux. Les modeles precliniques contribuent aux analyses d'efficacite dermo-cosmetiques et a la justification des allegations de modulateurs de croissance capillaire. Les modeles in vitro visant a etudier la croissance des cheveux utilisent les cellules du derme papillaire (Dermal Papilla Cells, DPC) du follicule pileux, des cellules mesenchymateuses specialisees situees a la base du follicule pileux, qui jouent un role essentiel dans la morphogenese du follicule pileux et les cycles de croissance capillaire post-natals. Dans cette revue, nous avons compile et examine la vaste litterature rapportee, mentionnant les DPC comme modele in vitro pour etudier les effets stimulateur et inhibiteur de la croissance capillaire. Divers agents, tels que les extraits naturels et des extraits de plantes, les facteurs de croissance et les cytokines, le plasma riche en plaquettes, l'extrait de placenta, les cellules souches et le milieu conditionne, les peptides, les hormones, les nanovecteurs lipidiques, la lumiere, la stimulation du champ electrique et electromagnetique, les androgenes et leurs analogues, les serums anti-stress et les agents chimiotherapeutiques, entre autres, ont ete examines pour leurs effets modulateurs de la croissance capillaire au niveau des DPC. Les effets sur l'activite des DPC ont ete determines a partir de niveaux non traites (basiques) ou induits par le stress.

Cette revue exhaustive et approfondie resume les informations et connaissances actualisees concernant les modeles de selection bases sur les DPC pour la croissance des cheveux, et peut permettre aux chercheurs de selectionner le systeme de test et les biomarqueurs appropries. Cette revue met en evidence le role fondamental des DPC au premier plan de la recherche capillaire comme plateformes de selection, en fournissant un apercu du mecanisme au niveau cellulaire, ce qui peut orienter encore davantage le developpement de nouveaux modulateurs de croissance capillaire.","[Madaan, Alka; Verma, Ritu; Singh, Anu T.; Jaggi, Manu] Dabur Res Fdn, Cell Biol Lab, 22,Site 4, Ghaziabad 201010, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Madaan, A (corresponding author), Dabur Res Fdn, Cell Biol Lab, 22,Site 4, Ghaziabad 201010, Uttar Pradesh, India.",alka.madaan2012@gmail.com,,,,,,,,64,68,5,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,INT J COSMETIC SCI,Int.

Adult human dermal papilla cells lose their hair-inductive capacity after several in vitro culture passages. Maintaining the hair-inductive capacity of adult human dermal papilla cells is an obstacle that needs to be overcome to realize tissue-engineered hair follicles. We hypothesized that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a fibrogenic factor known to influence Wnt, BMP and TGF-, could influence key signalling pathways in human dermal papilla cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous connective tissue growth factor on cultured human dermal papilla cells. MethodsAdult human dermal papilla cells were isolated and cultured in the presence of CTGF (20 or 40ngmL(-1)). Human dermal papilla cells positivity was determined using the alkaline phosphatase immunofluorescence. After treatment with CTGF, the proliferation of human dermal papilla cells was assessed. The presence of connective tissue growth factor in human dermal papilla cells was identified by immunofluorescence. The -smooth muscle actin protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. Gene expression profile of Wnt, BMP and TGF- signalling pathways as well as alkaline phosphatase and versican activity, were determined using real-time RT-PCR. ResultsConnective tissue growth factor reduced proliferation rate of cultured human dermal papilla cells in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous connective tissue growth factor increased the expression of cytoplasmic connective tissue growth factor, and increased mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase and -catenin, BMP2 and TGF-2 in human dermal papilla cells. Versican mRNA level was suppressed and a small increase in -smooth muscle actin protein expression was observed. ConclusionExogenous connective tissue growth factor can preserve the innate hair-inductive ability of adult human dermal papilla cells in vitro cultures, which is controlled through the Wnt, BMP and TGF- signalling pathways.

Des cellules de papilles dermiques humains adultes perdent leurs capacite inductive du cheveux apres plusieurs passages in vitro en culture. Le maintien de la capacite inductive des cellules adultes de papilles dermiques humains est un obstacle qui doit etre surmonte afin de realiser l'ingenierie tissulaire des follicules pileux. Nous avons suppose que le facteur de croissance du tissu conjonctif (CTGF), un facteur fibrogenique connu pour influencer Wnt, BMP, TGF- pourrait influer sur les voies de signalisation cles dans les cellules de papilles dermiques humains. Le but de cette etude etait de determiner l'effet du CTGF exogene sur des cellules en culture de papilles dermiques humains. MethodesDes cellules de papilles dermiques humains adultes ont ete isolees et cultivees en presence de CTGF (20ngmL(-1) ou 40ngmL(-1)). L'identite des cellules de papilles dermiques humains a ete determinee en utilisant l'immunofluorescence de la phosphatase alcaline. Apres traitement avec le CTGF, la proliferation des cellules de papilles dermiques humains a ete evaluee. La presence de facteur de croissance tissulaire dans les cellules de papilles dermiques humaines a ete identifiee par immunofluorescence. L'expression de la proteine de l'actine du muscle lisse- a ete evaluee par western blot. Le profil d' expression des genes de Wnt, BMP, de signalisation de TGF et l'activite - versicane de la phosphatase alcaline ont ete determine en utilisant en temps reel, la RT-PCR. ResultatsLe CTGF reduit les taux de proliferation des cellules de papilles dermiques humaines cultivees, d'une maniere dependante de la dose. Le CTGF exogene augmente l'expression cytoplasmique du facteur de croissance du tissu conjonctif, et augmente l'expression de l'ARNm de la phosphatase alcaline et la -catenine, BMP2 et de TGF- 2 dans des cellules de papilles dermiques humaines. Le niveau de l'ARNm de Versican a ete supprime et on a observe une legere augmentation de l'expression de la proteine de l'actine du muscle lisse .

CAPITATA; CABBAGE; SOIL; CHALLENGES; NITROGEN; YIELD,"In a field experiment with white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata (L.) alef.) in Germany, three irrigation scheduling approaches were tested: (i) three sprinkler irrigation schedules based on soil water balance calculations using different development-dependent crop coefficients; (ii) automatic drip irrigation based on soil water tension thresholds; (iii) irrigation scheduling by real-time application of a partially calibrated mechanistic crop growth model. Multi-objective calibration was applied to derive a fully calibrated model as a diagnostic tool to identify the water loss terms of the individual irrigation strategies. The results of the experiment showed that: (i) high yields can be achieved with relatively low amounts of irrigation water (similar to 100mm), provided the optimal irrigation strategy and technique are applied; (ii) automated tension threshold-based drip irrigation outperformed soil water balance or crop growth model-based strategies; (iii) the soil water balance calculation approach relying on recommended K-c factors led to an enormous overirrigation; (iv) the application of a partially calibrated crop growth model led to an underestimation of the crop water requirements in conjunction with an incorrect timing of irrigation events and therefore resulted in the lowest yields. The diagnostic model identified percolation, for the wet sprinkler irrigation treatments, and canopy evaporation, for the dry and model-based treatments, as major water loss sources; only minimal additional water was lost in the tension-controlled treatment.

Des calibrations multiples objectives ont ete conduites pour deriver un modele entierement calibre, qui servira d'outil de diagnostic et d'identification des termes de perte d'eau resultant des strategies individuelles d'irrigation.Les resultats de l'experience ont montre que: (i) des rendements eleves peuvent etre atteints avec des quantites relativement faibles d'eau d'irrigation (similar to 100mm), a condition que les calendriers optimaux et que les techniques adaptees soient appliquees; (ii) l'irrigation au goutte a goutte a seuil de tension automatique a surperforme les strategies fondees bilan hydrique du sol bas e sur le modele de croissance des cultures; (iii) les methodes basees sur le calcul de bilan hydrique du sol a partir des coefficients culturaux K-c ont conduit a une enorme surirrigation; (iv) l'application d'un modele de croissance des cultures partiellement calibree a conduit a une sous-estimation des besoins en eau des cultures en conjonction avec une mauvaise synchronisation des tours d'eau et ont donc entraine les rendements les plus faibles.

Within a two-sector model, agricultural decline is explained by three basic driving forces (relative price change, Rybczynski effect, and technological gap). In a dynamic (vector autoregression) specification the share of agriculture on gross domestic product the agricultural relative price and the capital intensity are simultaneously determined. The model allows for short-run adjustments with respect to long-run equilibrium and for cross-sectional dependence taking into account interregional linkages. The approach is applied to the panel data set of 20 Italian regions over the period 1951-2002 of intense economic development but still persistent regional disparities.

MethodsWe obtained cross-sectional data from 8847 households in May-August 2013 from a baseline survey conducted for an evaluation of an integrated health intervention. We collected data on diarrhoea, water quality, and environmental and demographic factors from households with children <5, and anthropometry from children <2. We conducted log-binomial regression using diarrhoea, stunting and wasting as dependent variables. ResultsAmong children <5, 8.7% reported diarrhoea in the previous 7days. Among children <2, stunting prevalence was 34.9% and wasting prevalence was 2.1%. Drinking water treatment (any method) was inversely associated with caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the previous 7days (PR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.91). Improved source of drinking water (PR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.87), appropriate treatment of drinking water (PR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96), improved sanitation facility (PR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.97), and complete structure (having walls, floor and roof) of the sanitation facility (PR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.84) were inversely associated with stunting. None of the exposure variables were associated with wasting. A microbiological indicator of water quality was not associated with diarrhoea or stunting. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that in Rusizi district, appropriate treatment of drinking water may be an important factor in diarrhoea in children <5, while improved source and appropriate treatment of drinking water as well as improved type and structure of sanitation facility may be important for linear growth in children <2. We did not detect an association with water quality.

ObjetivoExplorar las asociaciones entre factores ambientales y demograficos con la diarrea y el estatus nutricional de ninos del distrito de Rusizi, Ruanda. MetodosHemos obtenido datos croseccionales de 8,847 hogares entre Mayo y Agosto del 2013 de una encuesta basal realizada por la evaluacion de una intervencion integral en salud. Hemos recogido datos sobre diarrea, calidad del agua, factores ambientales y demograficos de hogares con ninos <5 anos, y antropometria de ninos <2 anos. Hemos realizado una regresion logistica binaria utilizando diarrea, la atrofia y el marasmo como variables dependientes. ResultadosDe los ninos <5 anos, un 8.7% reporto diarrea en los ultimos 7 dias. Entre los ninos <2 anos, la prevalencia de atrofia era del 34.9% y la prevalencia de marasmo del 2.1%. El tratamiento del agua para consumo (cualquier metodo) estaba inversamente asociada con la diarrea reportada por el cuidador en los siete dias previos (PR=0.79, IC 95%: 0.68-0.91).

It is shown that heterogeneity induces technical change to be biased towards resource-intensive sectors. Along the balanced growth path, the sectoral structure of the economy is constant as the higher resource dependency in resource-intensive sectors is compensated by enhanced research activities. Resource taxes have no impact on dynamics except when the tax rate varies over time. Research subsidies and the sectoral provision of productivity-enhancing public goods raise growth and provide an effective tool for structural policy.On analyse la dynamique a long terme d'une economie dans laquelle les secteurs sont heterogenes pour ce qui est de l'intensite dans l'usage des ressources naturelles. On montre que cette heterogeneite engendre un changement technique biaise dans la direction des secteurs a forte intensite dans l'usage de la ressource naturelle. Le long d'un sentier de croissance balancee, la structure sectorielle de l'economie est constante a proportion que la dependance plus grande de la ressource dans les secteurs a forte intensite d'utilisation de la ressource est compensee par des activites de recherche plus importantes. Les taxes sur la ressource n'ont pas d'effet sur la dynamique si ce n'est quand les taux de taxation varient dans le temps.

Abundance of natural resources in several developing countries had significant implications for their economic growth and subsequent income inequality levels. Further, neoliberal globalization manifested itself in increased foreign direct investment and trade openness impacted world economies significantly. This research examines the effects of natural resource dependency, neoliberal globalization, and state-institutional factors alongside the internal development model on income inequality in a set of 96 developing countries for the period 1980-2010. Models for Prais-Winsten regressions with panel corrected standard errors show that within the internal development model, population growth rates are the most significant factor in influencing income inequality levels. Natural resource dependency is equally important and is positively associated with increasing inequalities. More detailed analyses of different types of energy-rich countries reveal varying results exemplifying the importance of exploring how different types of natural resources might affect income inequality levels rather than their sheer magnitude. Consistent with previous research, foreign direct investment indicates a robust positive association with increasing income inequalities whereas trade openness exhibits a negative association signifying the positive effect deindustrialization that took place in advanced countries might have had on developing countries. Finally and counterintuitively, democracy is associated with higher income inequalities whereas institutional quality is negatively associated with income inequality. Resume Contrairement a l'ideologie neoliberale dominante affirmant que les taux de croissance economique eleves favorisent a terme une meilleure repartition des revenus, les trois dernieres decennies ont ete marquees par une augmentation des inegalites de revenus dans la plupart des pays a forte croissance dans le monde. De meme, l'abondance en ressources naturelles de certains pays en developpement a des consequences importantes sur la croissance economique et les niveaux d'inegalite de revenus. En favorisant l'augmentation des investissements directs etrangers et l'ouverture des marches, la mondialisation neoliberale exerce aussi une forte pression sur les economies nationales. Cet article examine les effets de la dependance aux ressources naturelles, de la mondialisation neoliberale, de la gestion institutionnelle de l'Etat et des modeles de developpement national sur l'inegalite des revenus dans 96 pays en developpement pour la periode 1980-2010. Des modeles de regression Prais-Winstein avec ecarts types corriges longitudinaux montrent que les taux de croissance de la population sont les facteurs les plus importants intervenants dans le modele de developpement interne. La dependance aux ressources naturelles joue egalement un role important dans l'augmentation des inegalites. Il existe une correlation positive entre l'augmentation des inegalites de revenus et les investissements directs etrangers et une association negative avec l'ouverture des marches. La comparaison des resultats des pays riches en ressources naturelles revele l'importance de la nature des ressources naturelles sur l'inegalite de revenus. Resumen Diferentemente de la ideologia neoliberal predominante que argumento que mayores tasas de crecimiento economico eventualmente conducirian a mejores resultados en terminos de distribucion del ingreso, las ultimas tres decadas fueron testigo de altas tasas de crecimiento economico acompanado por el aumento de las desigualdades de ingresos en la mayoria de paises del mundo. La abundancia de recursos naturales en varios paises en desarrollo tuvo consecuencias importantes en su crecimiento economico y en los niveles de desigualdad de ingresos posteriores. Ademas, la globalizacion neoliberal se manifesto en un aumento de la inversion extranjera directa y la apertura del comercio impacto significativamente en las economias mundiales. Esta investigacion examina los efectos de la dependencia de los recursos naturales, la globalizacion neoliberal y los factores institucionales-del estado, junto con el modelo de desarrollo interno en la desigualdad del ingreso en un conjunto de 96 paises en desarrollo para el periodo 1980-2010. Los modelos de regresion Prais-Winsten con paneles corrigiendo el error estandar muestran que las tasas de crecimiento de la poblacion son el factor mas importante en el modelo de desarrollo interno. La dependencia de los recursos naturales es igualmente importante y se asocia positivamente con el aumento de las desigualdades. La inversion extranjera directa indica una asociacion positiva robusta con el aumento de las desigualdades de ingresos, mientras que la apertura comercial exhibe una asociacion negativa. Finalmente, los resultados para los diferentes tipos de paises ricos en energia revelan la importancia de explorar como los diferentes tipos de recursos naturales podrian tener un efecto mayor en la desigualdad de ingresos en comparacion con su magnitud.","[ElGindi, Tamer] Qatar Univ, Dept Int Affairs, Publ Policy Environm & Sustainabil, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"ElGindi, T (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Dept Int Affairs, Coll Arts & Sci, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",telgindi@qu.edu.qa,,,,,,,,3,3,2,75,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,CURR SOCIOL,Curr.

J,"Bloch, R",,,,"Bloch, Robin",,,Dubai's Long Goodbye,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,real estate development; economic development; urban planning; Dubai,,"This essay details the effects of the global economic crisis on Dubai and assesses the future implications for urban and economic development in Dubai itself and within its broader sphere of influence. Dubai's real estate-led six-year boom between 2003 and 2008 is located within the emirate's growth strategy, which expressed the ruling al-Maktoum family's long-running ambition for the city-state to ascend to global-city status on the basis of significant investment in economic infrastructure over decades to service a regional trading-hub role. Urban development during the boom years was accelerated in terms of process and built outcomes as state-backed real estate companies borrowed heavily on capital markets and designed and constructed an extraordinary array of commercial, industrial, retail, residential and tourism facilities to cater for a planned population increase on the basis of growing economic activity. The global economic crisis brought the boom years to an end from late 2008 onwards: construction slowed down, if it did not halt altogether, property values dropped by half, and the finances of state-owned companies are undergoing restructuring in the face of creditor demands. A durable pick-up in economic growth is likely to impel Dubai's ruling elite to re-emphasize the city's regional trading and service-centre role based on strong investment in aviation, shipping and logistics infrastructure. While real estate development will be demoted as an economic priority, Dubai's city-building practices will continue to influence the current wave of global suburbanization in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Resume Ce texte examine les effets de la crise economique mondiale sur Dubai, en evaluant les implications pour le developpement economique et urbain a venir, tant a Dubai que dans sa sphere d'influence. L'essor immobilier entre 2003 et 2008 s'inscrit dans la strategie de croissance de l'emirat. Celle-ci reflete l'ambition deja ancienne de la famille Al Maktoum au pouvoir, qui vise a faire de l'Etat-cite une ville planetaire, s'appuyant sur des decennies d'investissements considerables dans l'infrastructure economique afin d'assurer le role de plaque tournante du commerce regional. Pendant les six annees d'expansion, l'amenagement urbain a explose en termes de processus et de constructions, les promoteurs soutenus par l'Etat empruntant massivement sur les marches financier, et ayant concu et bati un ensemble extraordinaire de sites commerciaux, industriels, residentiels et touristiques afin de faire face a l'accroissement prevu de la population dans un cadre de prosperite economique. La periode d'essor s'est heurtee a la crise mondiale a partir de la fin 2008: ralentissement (voire arret) des constructions, valeur de l'immobilier divisee par deux, et entreprises detenues par l'Etat forcees de restructurer leurs finances pour repondre aux exigences de leurs creanciers. Une reprise durable de la croissance economique devrait inciter l'elite dirigeante de Dubai a recentrer la ville dans son role de centre regional de service et de commerce grace a des investissements importants dans les infrastructures aeronautiques, maritimes et logistiques. Meme si l'amenagement immobilier n'apparait plus comme une priorite economique, la construction urbaine realisee a Dubai reste une source d'inspiration pour la nouvelle vague de suburbanisation mondiale que connaissent le Moyen-Orient, l'Afrique et l'Asie.","[Bloch, Robin] GHK Consulting Ltd, Birmingham B3 1QZ, W Midlands, England",,"Bloch, R (corresponding author), GHK Consulting Ltd, 30 St Pauls Sq, Birmingham B3 1QZ, W Midlands, England.",Robin.Bloch@ghkint.com,,,,,,,,28,28,0,35,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",,,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

To tackle these problems, an innovative pipe-envelope concept was tested on a 50ha pilot area in Harran, Turkey, in 2015 and 2016. The new concept, HYDROLUIS, consists of a corrugated inner pipe with three rows of perforations at the top and an unperforated outer pipe that covers about 2/3 of the inner pipe leaving only the unperforated bottom part of the inner pipe in contact with the soil. The main advantages of the new concept are that it works for a wide range of soil textures and there is better protection against root growth inside the pipe. The new concept was compared with a geotextile envelope, a gravel envelope and a control with no envelope. The HYDROLUIS and gravel envelopes had a significantly lower entrance resistance compared to the geotextile, the best drain performance and no signs of sedimentation nor of root growth inside the pipe. The production costs of the HYDROLUIS envelope are comparable to those of pre-wrapped synthetic envelopes and considerably lower than gravel envelopes. It can be concluded that the HYDROLUIS envelope is a promising alternative for sand/gravel or synthetic envelopes in irrigated lands. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Annual vegetation includes most of the crop species grown in central North America (e.g., corn, soybeans, cereal grains, canola), and perennial vegetation includes hay and forage crops (e.g., alfalfa) and most non-crop land covers (e.g., woodlands, grasslands, wetlands). Recent data show that in farmlands perennial cover is converting to annual cover. Using new remotely sensed annual crop layer spatial data for an intensively farmed region (1,700 km(2)) of the Lake Huron watershed in Southern Ontario, Canada, this paper describes changes in farmland composition and which transitions are occurring, with suggestions for why the changes are occurring. Perennial cover has rapidly been converted to annual cover in the past five years, with working-lands perennial cover types identified as the most vulnerable to conversion. Other land cover types are relatively static. Implications for agricultural land conservation and stewardship require attention to this rapid change for conservation of soil, water, and biodiversity in the Great Lakes basin. Pertes recentes de la couverture vegetale dans une region agricole des Grands Lacs La composition des paysages est consecutive aux fonctions ecologiques et, dans les regions agricoles, un simple descripteur de la composition est de savoir si l'habitude de croissance de la vegetation est annuelle ou perenne.

Les donnees recentes indiquent que dans les terres cultivees, la couverture perenne se convertit en couverture annuelle.

What determines the location of offshore production? How do countries' policies and characteristics affect a firm's decision about where to offshore? Do firms choose specific countries because of the countries' policies or because they know them better? In this paper, we use a rich dataset on Danish firms to analyze how decisions to offshore production depend on the institutional characteristics of the country and firm-specific bilateral networks. We find that institutions that reduce credit risk and corruption increase the probability that firms will offshore there, while those that increase regulation in the labour market decrease this probability. We also show that a firm's probability of offshoring increases with the share of its employees who are immigrants from that country of origin. Finally, our analysis reveals that the negative impact of institutions that hinder offshoring is attenuated by a strong bilateral network of foreign workers. Resume Role des institutions et des reseaux d'immigrants dans la decision des entreprises de delocaliser.

Les entreprises choisissent-elles certains pays en raison de leurs politiques ou parce qu'ils les connaissent mieux? Dans cet article, nous nous appuyons sur un ensemble exhaustif de donnees d'entreprises danoises afin d'analyser en quoi les decisions de delocaliser la production dependent des caracteristiques institutionnelles du pays de delocalisation ainsi que des reseaux bilateraux specifiques aux entreprises. Nous constatons que les institutions permettant de reduire le risque lie au credit et la corruption augmentent la probabilite qu'une entreprise delocalise a cet endroit, tandis que celles qui renforcent la reglementation du marche du travail la reduisent. Nous montrons egalement que lorsqu'une partie des salaries d'une entreprise sont originaires d'un pays en particulier, alors la probabilite que l'entreprise delocalise vers ce meme pays augmente.

Dried distillers grain with soluble (DDGS) was found to be a more cost-effective source of energy, amino acids, and phosphorus than either corn, soybean meal, or canola meal, and consequently, its inclusion in the ration reduces feed costs by approximately 13% across the three growth phases for a representative Ontario pig farm. It would require a significant increase in the relative price of DDGS before it would not be part of the least-cost feed formulation at the maximum rate allowed (25% of the ration). The inclusion of DDGS increases the protein and phosphorus content of the ration, and consequently, the manure content of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, if DDGS makes up more than 15% of the ration. The resulting savings to fertilizer costs associated with DDGS will depend on factors such as fertilizer prices, crop needs, and manure nutrient changes, but the benefits, regardless of the scenario, are significantly smaller than the savings to feed costs. Consequently, the use of DDGS in the swine ration is determined primarily through its ability as a cost-effective source of energy and phosphorus, but the saving has been less than the overall feed ingredient price increase since 2006. Les augmentations de prix des ingredients entrant dans la composition des aliments pour animaux qui ont touche defavorablement les eleveurs de betail peuvent etre contrebalancees par lutilisation de coproduits issus de lune des raisons possibles de ces augmentations de prix, a savoir la production dethanol. Les solubles de distillerie (DDGS) se sont revelees une source denergie, damino-acides et de phosphore plus economique que le mais, le tourteau de soya ou de canola, et leur utilisation dans les rations a permis de diminuer les couts des aliments pour animaux denviron 13 p. 100 au cours des trois phases de croissance sur une ferme porcine typique en Ontario. Il faudrait que le prix relatif des DDGS augmente considerablement pour que les DDGS nentrent pas dans la formulation des aliments pour animaux a moindre cout au taux maximal permis (25 p. 100 de la ration). Lajout de DDGS accroit la teneur de la ration en proteines et en phosphore et, par consequent, la teneur du fumier en azote et en phosphore a condition que les DDGS constituent plus de 15 p. 100 de la ration. Les economies de couts des engrais liees a lutilisation des DDGS dependent de certains facteurs tels que le prix des engrais, les besoins des cultures en elements nutritifs et les changements dans les elements nutritifs du fumier mais les avantages, peu importe le scenario, sont significativement moins eleves que les economies de couts des aliments pour animaux. En consequence, lutilisation de DDGS dans la ration pour porcs est principalement determinee par la capacitea constituer une source denergie et de phosphore economique, mais les economies sont inferieures aux avantages alimentaires globaux.","[Skinner, Stewart; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [deLange, Cornelius F.] Univ Guelph, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Weersink, A (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",stuskinner@gmail.com; aweersin@uoguelph.ca; cdelange@uoguelph.ca,,,"Ontario Ministry of Agricultural Food and Rural Affairs; Ontario Pork; Business Economics Group, Wageningen University","Ontario Ministry of Agricultural Food and Rural Affairs; Ontario Pork; Business Economics Group, Wageningen University","The authors thank the CJAE editor and reviewers for their constructive comments.

The MBECTM assay device was used to evaluate optimum parameters for growing artificial biofilms. These conditions were determined to be 7days of growth at 23 degrees C in a yeast extract-glucose-mineral salts medium. As expected, the bacteria in the biofilm state were more resistant to disinfection by chemical treatment with sodium hypochlorite, quaternary ammonium, and hydrogen peroxide when compared with planktonic cells. Artificial biofilms were also grown on five different surface materials typically found in commercial potato storage facilities (concrete, mild steel, rubber, polycarbonate and wood) using the BESTTM assay device to test the effect of surface type on biofilm susceptibility to disinfection. Sodium hypochlorite was the most effective disinfectant on the wood surface and hydrogen peroxide was best on the mild steel surface. Efficacies of the various disinfectants were not significantly different on concrete, rubber and polycarbonate surfaces. When artificially grown biofilms and those grown naturally in potato tissue were transferred to, and dried onto, coupons of the different surface materials, they were significantly more difficult to inactivate than in situ grown biofilms. The resistance of plant pathogenic bacteria in the biofilm state, particularly when spread and dried onto surfaces of agricultural machines and other equipment, to commonly used disinfectants, has important implications for disease control strategies that depend largely on strict sanitary and hygienic practices. ResumeLa sensibilite des biofilms de Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, l'agent causal de la pourriture du cerne chez la pomme de terre, a trois desinfectants agricoles courants a ete testee. Le biotest MBECTM a ete utilise pour evaluer les parametres optimaux relatifs a la croissance de biofilms artificiels. Ces conditions ont ete etablies a sept jours de croissance a 23 degrees C sur un milieu a base d'extrait de levure, de glucose et de sels mineraux. Comme nous nous y attendions, lorsque comparees aux cellules planctoniques, les bacteries a l'etat de biofilms etaient plus resistantes a la desinfection chimique effectuee avec de l'hypochlorite de sodium, de l'ammonium quaternaire et du peroxyde d'hydrogene. Des biofilms artificiels ont egalement ete cultives sur cinq differents materiaux de surface trouves generalement dans les entrepots commerciaux pour pommes de terre (beton, acier doux, caoutchouc, polycarbonate et bois). Ces derniers ont ete evalues avec le biotest MBECTM afin d'estimer l'influence du type de surface sur la sensibilite des biofilms a la desinfection. L'hypochlorite de sodium s'est revele le desinfectant le plus efficace sur le bois, et le peroxyde d'hydrogene s'est avere le plus efficace sur l'acier doux. Les taux d'efficacite des divers desinfectants n'etaient pas significativement differents sur les surfaces en beton, en caoutchouc et en polycarbonate. Quand les biofilms cultives artificiellement et ceux cultives naturellement sur des tissus de pomme de terre ont ete transferes, et seches, sur des coupons des differents materiaux, ils etaient significativement plus difficiles a inactiver que les biofilms cultives in situ. La resistance des bacteries pathogenes, a l'etat de biofilms, aux desinfectants utilises couramment, particulierement lorsque ces biofilms sont appliques et seches sur la machinerie agricole et les autres equipements, a d'importantes implications quant aux strategies de lutte contre la maladie qui dependent en grande partie de mesures sanitaires et hygieniques strictes.","[Howard, R.

They do not create yield, but protect an inherent yield potential that the grower may realize in the absence of disease. In the field, securing effective disease control from fungicide applications is dependent upon the disease pressure and the effectiveness of the fungicide to control that disease. Globally, the same fungicide active ingredients are used against a similar range of fungal pathogens. However, in the presence of the pathogen, the level of economic response to fungicide applications is primarily driven by the prevailing environmental conditions and their interactions with crop development and the pathogen. Fungicides are canopy management tools that influence the size and duration of the green leaf area (GLA) of the crop. The total number of fungicide applications links to the length of the growing season and the disease risk in that period. For example, the top three leaves of a wheat crop canopy might warrant protection for approximately 120 days in an irrigated wheat crop on the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand, but only 60 days in the dry land wheat crops of the Victorian Mallee in Australia. Combining our knowledge of fungicide effect on the crop canopy with soil water and nutrient availability enables better matching of fungicide product, dose and timing to a specific disease risk. It also enables better use of crop physiology models, such as APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), to assist with in-crop fungicide decisions. This paper reviews the role of fungicides, principally the triazoles (FRAC Group 3), strobilurins (Group 11) and SDHI's succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (Group 7), in cereal disease management. It explains (i) why applying foliar fungicide by plant development stage (as well as disease threshold) confers advantages when fungicide mode of action and on-farm logistics are taken into consideration; (ii) gives examples of how fungicide management strategies are adjusted in Australia and New Zealand to take account of environmental conditions; and (iii) explains the importance of green leaf retention (GLR) in the realization of an economic response from fungicides. ResumeLes fongicides constituent l'ultime ligne de defense dans l'arsenal d'une approche de gestion des maladies par lutte integree. Ils n'accroissent pas le rendement, mais protegent le rendement possible qu'un producteur pourrait obtenir en l'absence de maladies. Au champ, la lutte efficace contre les maladies decoulant de l'application de fongicides depend de la pression exercee par la maladie et de l'efficacite du fongicide a lutter contre cette maladie. Globalement, les memes ingredients actifs d'un fongicide sont utilises contre une gamme d'agents pathogenes fongiques similaires. Toutefois, en presence d'un agent pathogene, le niveau de reponse economique aux applications de fongicide est avant tout conditionne par les conditions courantes du milieu et leurs interactions avec le developpement vegetatif et l'agent pathogene. Les fongicides sont des outils de gestion du couvert vegetal qui influencent la taille et la duree de la surface foliaire verte de la culture. Le nombre total d'applications de fongicide est lie a la longueur de la saison de croissance et au risque d'incidence de la maladie durant cette periode. Par exemple, les trois feuilles superieures du ble, en tant que couvert vegetal, peuvent offrir une protection pendant environ 120 jours dans un champ irrigue dans les plaines de Canterbury en Nouvelle-Zelande, mais seulement 60 sur les terres arides du Mallee australien de la region de Victoria. La combinaison de nos connaissances sur les effets des fongicides sur le couvert vegetal de la culture a l'eau du sol et a la disponibilite des nutriments permet de mieux cibler le produit ainsi que la quantite a utiliser et de synchroniser son application en fonction du risque possible d'une maladie particuliere. Cela permet egalement une meilleure utilisation des modeles physiologiques des cultures comme APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) afin d'aider dans le choix du fongicide pour la premiere application de postlevee. Cet article passe en revue le role des fongicides, principalement des triazoles (FRAC Groupe 3), des strobilurines (Groupe 11) et des inhibiteurs de la succinate deshydrogenase (Groupe 7) dans la gestion des maladies des cereales. Il explique pourquoi l'application d'un fongicide foliaire en fonction des stades de developpement de la plante (et du seuil de la maladie) offre des avantages quand le mode d'action du fongicide et la logistique associee a la ferme sont pris en consideration; il donne des exemples de l'adaptation des strategies de gestion des fongicides utilisees en Australie et en Nouvelle-Zelande visant a prendre en compte les conditions de milieu; et il explique l'importance de la retention de la surface foliaire verte afin d'obtenir une reponse economique a l'utilisation des fongicides.","[Poole, N.

MethodsProspective controlled trial involving children aged 0-5 years living in four groups of villages in a KBD-endemic rural area of central Tibet who received either calcium and/or vitamin D or no supplement. The cohort was followed over 3 years. Primary outcome was the impact of the different supplementation regimes on KBD, rickets and growth; secondary outcomes were impact on urinary levels of calcium and phosphorus, biomarkers of bone and cartilage turnover, and dental health. ResultsNo difference was observed between the four groups with regard to anthropometric data, rickets, KBD, urinary levels of CrossLaps((R)) and CartiLaps((R)). Weight for height or age, mid-upper arm circumference and skinfold thickness decreased in the four groups. Height for age increased and the prevalence of KBD fell in the four groups. Dental health was better in the group receiving calcium and vitamin D. Urinary calcium levels increased after 3 years of follow-up in all groups; the group receiving vitamin D had a higher increase (P-value: 0.044). The same global increase was observed for urinary phosphorus levels; the group receiving calcium had a higher increase (P-value: 0.01). ConclusionsCalcium and vitamin D failed to improve growth and bone metabolism of children living in a KBD-endemic rural area. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation improved dental health. ObjectifEvaluer l'effet du calcium (15 mmol/jour) et de la vitamine D (625 g/mois), comme supplement unique ou en combinaison, par rapport a aucun supplement sur la croissance, les signes cliniques du rachitisme et de la maladie de Kashin-Beck (KBD) et la sante dentaire. MethodesEssai controle prospectif impliquant des enfants ages de 0 a 5 ans vivant dans 4 groupes de villages dans une zone rurale endemique pour la KBD dans le centre du Tibet qui ont recu soit du calcium et/ou de la vitamine D ou aucun supplement. La cohorte a ete suivie sur 3 ans. Le principal resultat a ete l'impact des differents regimes de supplementation sur la KBD, le rachitisme et la croissance; les resultats secondaires etaient l'impact sur les taux urinaires de calcium et de phosphore, biomarqueurs de l'os et du renouvellement du cartilage, et la sante dentaire. ResultatsAucune difference n'a ete observee entre les 4 groupes en ce qui concerne les donnees anthropometriques, le rachitisme, la KBD, les taux urinaires de Croslaps((R)) et de Cartilaps((R)). Le poids pour la taille ou de l'age, la circonference a mi-hauteur du bras et l'epaisseur du pli cutane ont diminue dans les 4 groupes. La taille pour l'age a augmente et la prevalence de la KBD a chute dans les quatre groupes. La sante dentaire etait meilleure dans le groupe recevant du calcium et de la vitamine D.
